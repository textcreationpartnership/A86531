            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Rev. 14.13.</note> who now <hi>reſts from his labours, being dead in the Lord.</hi> And though this preſent work be but <hi>ſmall</hi> in quantitie, yet it comprehends a <hi>great</hi> many divine Truths: For thou ſhalt in this, as in a <hi>glaſſe,</hi> ſee thine owne condition, be it what it will: If thou be indeed a child of God, thou ſhalt find him herein a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a ſon of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thee, in diſcovering what thy <hi>Priviledges</hi> are, and what thy <hi>practiſe is,</hi> or <hi>ſhould</hi> be.

Theſe Sermons are upon ſeverall Texts of Scripture, which (I ſuppoſe) will prove the more delightfull for the <hi>variety,</hi> which is pleaſing to all. And though there bee no great dependance of theſe Sermons each upon other, yet the whole without forcing, may be reduced to theſe three Heads:

            </p>
            <p>In the three former Sermons is ſet forth the <hi>dignitie</hi> or <hi>priviledges</hi> of true beleevers. The ineſtimable gift of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the <hi>redemption</hi> of his people, is ſweetly and fully explained in the Firſt Sermon. In the Second is ſhewed, that Chriſt hath not only given himſelf <hi>for</hi> believers, but <hi>to</hi> them, and that he is <hi>in</hi> them, with the bleſſed Effects of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation.
<pb facs="tcp:114897:3"/>In the Third, thou ſhalt find the happie condition of the people of God, being now freed from the <hi>Law,</hi> and under <hi>Grace,</hi> the Priviledges whereof are inlarged in ſeverall Branches.</p>
            <p>The <hi>duties</hi> of the Saints that injoy theſe <hi>dignities,</hi> and <hi>priviledges,</hi> are ſet forth in the two next Sermons. In the Fourth, That they ought <hi>only</hi> to <hi>attend</hi> to the voice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>the wiſedome of the Father,</hi> and to be <hi>obedient</hi> to him. In the Fifth, is ſhewed what <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> is required of them, even the <hi>obedience of Faith,</hi> which is ſet forth in the <hi>fruitfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>activitie</hi> of it, in their Imitation of <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father of the faithfull.</hi> And then in the two laſt Sermons is laid down the <hi>danger</hi> of neglecting theſe <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>remiſsneſs</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> under the means of knowledge, and grace, which is the ſum of the Sixth Sermon; or elſe, which is worſe, by hardning the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>inſtruction</hi> and <hi>reproof,</hi> which is the Subject of the laſt; that thoſe that will not ſweetly be <hi>drawn</hi> by the cords of <hi>love,</hi> ſhall

                  <p>The Lord Chriſt is deſcribed in this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe by an Act of his, <hi>Who gave himſelf for us;</hi> and this ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt it is illuſtrated; Firſt, by the Object for whom it was done, <hi>He gave himſelf for us:</hi> Secondly, By the end, Why it was done, <hi>That he might redeem us from all iniquitie, and purifie to himſelfe a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Coherence of theſe words, and the Scope of them, and alſo the Parts of the Text; They are, the Action of Chriſt deſcribed, by the Object and End of it.</p>
                  <p>We will firſt ſpeak of the Action and Object, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them both together, <hi>Who gave himſelf for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Give me leave to ſpend a little time in the opening of the Words. And firſt, what is meant here by <hi>us?</hi> Who they are that are the object of this action of Chriſt? Who they are for whom Chriſt gave himſelfe?</p>
                  <p>In a word, the Perſons for whom Chriſt gave himſelf, they are beleevers: In 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.10. he is there ſaid to be the <hi>Saviour of all men,</hi> eſpecially of thoſe <hi>that beleeve.</hi> You ſee in the Verſe before my Text, he is called our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> how he gave himſelf for them to whom he is a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but (ſaith the Apoſtle) he <hi>is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially of thoſe that beleive.</hi> The meaning of the place is this, Chriſt he ſaveth all men with a common temporall ſalvation, he ſaveth them from many dangers, from many miſeries, he is a generall Saviour to all men; but a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Saviour to ſave from Hell, from the wrath of God, from the guilt and power of ſin; thus ſpecially the Lord Chriſt is a Saviour only to them that beleeve: So that by the Object of this Act, (included in the word <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,] he gave himſelf for us</hi>) is meant beleevers, them that doe beleeve in him.</p>
                  <p>What this belief is, I think I ſhall not need now to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114897:6"/>declare unto you; I will but onely touch it in a few words.</p>
                  <p>To beleeve in Chriſt then, it is nothing elſe, but for a man to goe out of himſelf, and to receive the Lord Chriſt in all his Offices, to be to us in particular, a King to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us, a Prophet to teach us, and a Prieſt to ſave us, and to make interceſſion for us: Thus Faith is deſcribed, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him,</hi> that is, (as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Verſe hath it) to as many as beleeved in him, <hi>He gave power to be the ſons of God.</hi> So that to beleeve in Chriſt, is to receive Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now there is no receiving of Chriſt, but you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whole Chriſt, the coat of Chriſt was never divided, much leſſe is the perſon of Chriſt: if Chriſts coat and perſon was not divided, much leſſe the Offices of Chriſt: So that if to beleeve be to receive Chriſt, then to beleeve is to receive whole Chriſt in all his Offices. You ſee then what this faith is, it is to goe out of ones ſelf, and to entertain Chriſt, to be in particular for us our onely King, and Prieſt and Prophet; and therefore to give up our ſelves to Chriſt, as ſubjects to be guided by him as by our Soveraign: and as Schollers in all things to be taught by him as by our Maſter; and for to give up our ſelves to him alone to expect attonement, and to expect favour from God through his Prieſthood. This is to believe.</p>
                  <p>The Properties of this Faith, the ſigns of it, by which you may know that you are them for whom Chriſt gave himſelf, you ſhall find in Scripture to be theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, Faith it is ſaid to purifie the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. There ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he put no difference between us and them, purifying of their hearts by faith.</hi> There is one propertie of faith, It is a purifier of the heart, that is, where there is faith, there is a principle in that heart, whereby it commeth to be purified and cleanſed from the power and dominion of all originall corruption. Where ever there is faith, there is a pure principle in that ſoul which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth nothing but the cleanſing of the ſoul from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is inbred by nature.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:114897:7"/>
                  <p>Faith it doth not purifie the heart perfectly, but onely in part: It doth not purge out all corruption, but onely ſome; but yet this it doth, it eſtabliſheth in the ſoul a pure principle, whereby the ſoul is purged from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of all ſin, from the love of all ſin, from the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall delighting in any ſin; and whereby the ſoul is made to be continually purging of it ſelf from the remainders of corruption: Whence is that ſpeech you have in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Seeing you have purified your ſouls by obeying the truth;</hi> faith it purifieth the heart by planting in it a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which makes the heart purifie it ſelf; Thereupon is that you have in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3 3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf as he is pure.</hi> Hope it is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith; where there is faith, there is hope brought forth; where there is hope, this hope makes a man purifie himſelf, even as God is pure. I pray obſerve it, Hope with faith works in the ſoul, it looks upon God, and it doth make a man ſtrive to purifie himſelf, that he may come to be pure as God is: What ever impurity is diſcerned in the ſoul, there is not that hope which is the daughter of faith; faith and hope is continually labouring and ſtriving to work out that impuritie: that is the meaning of it, he purifieth himſelf even as God is pure, that even as a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler that is willing to learne, hee looks upon the Copie of his maſter, and upon his own writing, and where ever he findeth any default, he is continually ſtriving to mend that, and ſtill labouring every time more and more to be more conformable to his maſters copie; even thus, where ever there is faith, it doth produce hope, which hope makes the ſoul continually aim to conform it ſelf to the puritie of God, whom it hopeth fully to enjoy.</p>
                  <p>And that you may not be miſtaken, conſider thus much, that there will bee impuritie in the heart wherein there is faith, but yet where there is faith, there is a continuall purging out of impuritie, as it manifeſteth it ſelfe. You may conceive it by a ſimilitude, if a pot be boyling upon the fire, there will a ſcum ariſe, but yet they that are good houſe wives, and cleanly, and neat, they watch it, and as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114897:7"/>the ſcum riſeth up, they take it off and throw it away, happily more ſcum will ariſe, but ſtill as it riſeth they ſcum it off. Thus it is with the ſoul, impuritie will be in the heart wherein there is faith, and it manifeſteth it ſelf, and riſeth up when the ſoul is in action, but yet the heart that hath faith in it, eyeth the ſoul, and as it diſcovereth any impuritie, though it be never ſo ſecret, or never ſo ſmall, though it be never ſo agreeing to his naturall diſpoſition, it ſcummeth it off, and it is his continuall work and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make riddance of any corruption which doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>Here is the firſt Propertie whereby you may know them that are the Perſons for whom Chriſt gave himſelf, they are beleevers, and faith purifieth the heart.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Propertie of faith is that you have in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Faith which works by love.</hi> Where ever there is faith, it is working. Faith it is not an idle grace, it is not a fancie or an opinion that Chriſt hath died for us, and there is an end, but it is a working grace, where ever there is faith, there is work, and what work is it? it is a work of love.</p>
                  <p>There is a working of love, and a working by love, where ever there is faith. Firſt, there is a working of love; faith that beleeveth in Chriſt, works a love to Chriſt: Faith that beleeveth the pardon of ſin, it works a hatred of that ſin for whoſe pardon Chriſt bloud was ſhed, faith it works a love to the Image of Chriſt, to the honour of Chriſt, to the Goſpel of Chriſt: In a word, what ever is Chriſts, to that faith doth work a love where ever it is; ſo that whoſoever hath faith, they have in them a love to Chriſt, and to all the things of Chriſt: You may conceive it by this ſimilitude; If a woman have with a conjugall affection taken a man to be her husband, that ſame taking of him to be her husband, makes her love him, and all that is his; ſhe loves his name, his honour and credit, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, his contentment, his eaſe, his ſafety, his perſon, his friends: for that ſame conjugall affection which makes her to take him to be her husband, works love in her in all theſe particulars. To beleeve in the Lord Chriſt, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114897:8"/>but to take Chriſt (as I ſaid before) to be our hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: Now if we have taken him to be our husband, then we ſhall love him as a wife loveth her husband. There is the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>Again thirdly, a third Propertie of Faith is that in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>The breaſtplate of faith and love,</hi> faith is a Breſt-plate, there is the third property of faith. What is the uſe of a breſtplate? A breſtplate it doth fence and ſecure the heart from all danger, from all ſtabbs, from all injuries. Where there is faith, the ſoul is fenced as it were, with a breſtplate, ſo that it is neither drawn away from Chriſt, nor wounded with the fierie darts of Satan, or temptations of ſin. My brethren, I pray obſerve it, there is no faith, where the heart is not in ſome meaſure fenced from the wounds of ſin, and from the inſnarements of the world: Faith is a breſt-plate, there is the third.</p>
                  <p>Again, in the fourth and laſt place, the laſt propertie of faith that I will name, is that in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God overcommeth the world, and this is our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, even our faith.</hi> Obſerve that place, where there is faith, there is a victorie, and a victorie over the world: where ever there is faith, there is an overcomming of the world? To overcome the world, it is not to be overcome of the world; it is to perſiſt in ſetting our chiefeſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, notwithſtanding all the deviſes and attempts of the world, either by flattery or by frowns; either by favour, or by blowes; this is to overcome the world. Now then where ever there is faith, there is a victorie over the world: that ſoul which hath faith in it, it hath overcome the world, the care of the world was wont to overcome it, but now it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the care of the world; it is not ſo carefull for the world, as it is for Chriſt. The feares of the world were wont to overcome it, but now it hath overcome the feares of the world, it is not ſo afraid of all the worlds injuries and threats, as it is of Chriſts diſpleaſure: The pleaſures of the world were wont to overcome it, the world runneth after nothing ſo much as after worldly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114897:8"/>pleaſures, is delighted in nothing ſo much, as in ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſure, either of contentment, or profit, or friends, of riches, or honours: But now the ſoul that hath faith in it, it delighteth in nothing ſo much as in the comfort of the Spirit, in the communion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Thus (I pray conſider it, though I ſpeak but briefly of theſe things, yet conſider it) where ever there is faith, there is a victorie over the world, before there is faith, there the ſoul is a ſlave to the world, but if once there be faith, he is more then conquerour, he is not the worlds ſlave, but the world is his, the world is trampled under his feet, and is a dead flower to him, that hath neither beauty nor ſweetneſs in it.</p>
                  <p>Thus (my brethren) they that have theſe Properties, they whoſe hearts are purified, they who work by love, they whoſe hearts are fenced with a breſtplate that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſtollen from Chriſt, nor wounded with ſin, they that are conquerours over the world, they are beleevers. And ſo you ſee the firſt thing, the Object of this Act of Chriſt, The perſons for whom Chriſt gave himſelf: <hi>viz.</hi> for them that have a faith purifying the heart, for them that have a faith working by love, for them that have a faith that is as a breſtplate to their ſoul, for them that have a faith that overcometh the world, for theſe Chriſt gave himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now we come in the ſecond place to open the ſecond thing, that is the Act of Chriſt, the thing that Chriſt did, <hi>he gave himſelf</hi> for theſe beleevers.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by giving of himſelf? to give a thing in the generall, it is to put a thing out of ones own uſe and power, and freely to bequeath it to the uſe and power of another; this is in the generall to give a thing. But here I conceive giving is taken a little more ſtrictly, and not ſo largely, <hi>viz.</hi> that which we call giving a ranſome: For if you compare with this Text, that which you ſhall find in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſome for all,</hi> that is, for all ſorts and conditions of people, ſo that here by giving himſelf, is meant a giving himſelf as a ranſome. Now what it is to give a thing as a ranſome, you are to know it is this;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114897:9"/>It is to diſpoſe and order a thing ſo as that it may redeem another out of that diſtreſſe wherein he is: So then the meaning of theſe words, <hi>he gave himſelf for us,</hi> is this, That the Lord Chriſt did ſo diſpoſe of himſelf, that by him there may come a redemption to all beleevers from all that miſerie and diſtreſſe they are in by nature. This is the meaning of the words.</p>
                  <p>The words then thus explained, this Doctrine doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath given himſelf for all that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not ſtand to prove it, it is ſo plain and evident in the Text, onely let me give you one place which is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your wives as Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> By the Church is meant nothing elſe but the company of beleevers, now he ſo loved the Church, that is, the company of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that he gave himſelf for them to be their ranſome.</p>
                  <p>For the opening of the point, that you may ſee what this Action of Chriſt was, I will ſhew you the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things to which Chriſt gave himſelfe for beleevers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt gave himſelf to incarnation, to become a man for beleevers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt gave himſelf to a perfect obedience of the Law, to work all righteouſneſſe for beleevers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt gave himſelf to ſuffering; to paſſion, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
                  <p>Theſe I will briefly open, and ſo make uſe of the Point.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt thing to which the Lord Chriſt bequeathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the ſake of beleevers, it was for to be a man. For the underſtanding of this you muſt know, that Chriſt he was, as he is, God, he was not man, he was a ſpirit and not fleſh, he neither had bloud nor bones, nor any body at all; but yet for beleevers did Chriſt diſpoſe of himſelf ſo that he might become a man; he that was God, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon in Trinitie, the maker of all fleſh, he did ſo order it, that he gave up himſelf to Incarnation, to become a man. This is that you have excellently expreſt, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robberie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114897:9"/>to be equall with God,</hi> that is, who was God, Gods equall, one and the ſame with God, therefore equall with God in majeſtie, in power, in glory, in all perfection: Well, though he was God, yet <hi>he made himſelf of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of men.</hi> Here was the firſt thing Chriſt gave himſelf to, he gave himſelf to become fleſh, to become a man, and all this for beleevers. This was a great act, for the Creator to become a creature, for him that was eternall, inviſible, immortall, incorporeall, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, for him to be of the ſeed of man that was mortall, that was corporeall, that was viſible, and had ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the nature of beaſts. Nay, not only did the Lord Chriſt give himſelf to be a man, but he gave himſelf for beleevers to be of the loweſt ranke of men, therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>he tooke upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> There are two things in thoſe words: Firſt, <hi>he was made in the likeneſs of men,</hi> the meaning is not, that he was like a man, and no man, as ſome heretiques would have grounded upon this Text, for the Scripture plainly enough ſheweth that Chriſt was a man; but by the <hi>likeneſs of men</hi> here is meant, a likeneſs to them in all infirmities, <hi>ſin only excepted;</hi> hee was not only of the nature of man, but <hi>he gave himſelf</hi> to be like men in this frail and infirm condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are; ſo that he was ſubject to the like infirmities that men were, only without all ſin: that is meant by the <hi>likeneſſe of men.</hi> Chriſt he might have been a man and have lived without wearineſs, without faintneſs, without hunger and thirſt, he might have lived, without meat and drinke, without ſleep and reſt, as he doth now in heaven where he is a man: but Chriſt as he <hi>gave himſelf</hi> to be a man for beleevers, ſo <hi>he gave himſelf</hi> to be like men in all ſinleſſe infirmities for beleevers. Thus he abaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf below man, below man as mans nature was in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, below that which was the nature of men, he even gave himſelf to the meaneſt infirmities of men, without ſin.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114897:10"/>
                  <p>Another thing in theſe words is, <hi>In the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> he did not only give himſelf to be a man, and to be ſubject as men are to all ſinleſſe infirmities; but <hi>he gave himſelf</hi> to be in the loweſt ranke of men, even to be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant amongſt men, <hi>He took upon him the form of a ſervant.</hi> The Lord Chriſt might have been <hi>in the likeneſs of men,</hi> a man ſubject to all humane infirmities without ſin, and yet been a great man, a Commander, a Governour, a man of place: But for beleevers, <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf</hi> to be of the loweſt ranke of men, to be a ſervant, <hi>the Son of man came not to be miniſtred to, but to miniſter.</hi> Here is the Firſt thing to which Chriſt gave himſelf for beleevers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to become a man, ſubject to all ſinleſſe infirmities; to become of the meaneſt ranke of men, even a ſervant amongſt men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Second thing to which Chriſt gave himſelf for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, whereto he diſpoſed himſelf that he might be their ranſome, it is, to the obedience of this Law, to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all righteouſneſs, This is that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plentifully expreſſeth, you may take one place for all: <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. Chriſt there cometh to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized of him; Baptiſm was an Ordinance of God, appointed to men by the Law of God; Chriſt hee cometh and putteth himſelf under the obedience of this Law in this particular: <hi>John</hi> knowing what Chriſt was, that he was God, he refuſeth to baptize him, he knew Chriſt had no need to obey the Law in this, or any other particular; the Law was but the counterpain of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is in the nature of Chriſt as he is God: therefore what need he come to put himſelf under the Law, that was above the Law, of whoſe holineſſe and righteouſneſſe the Law was but a Coppie? Now what is our Saviours Anſwer? <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, Suffer it to be ſo, for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteouſneſſe:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>John,</hi> indeed, I know it is true, if you look upon ſtrict terms, there is no need I ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Law, yet notwithſtanding, though I need not, <hi>Let it be ſo, for it becommeth me to fulfill all righteouſneſſe:</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114897:10"/>I have given up my ſelf to this work, to fulfill the Law for them that to the worlds end ſhall beleeve in me.</p>
                  <p>Here then is the ſecond thing; Chriſt gave himſelf to the obedience of the Law, to the working of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: therefore it is that he is often deſcribed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be <hi>that juſt one, that holy one of God,</hi> one <hi>in whoſe mouth there is no guil,</hi> all which are but expreſſions of his obedience to the Law. This Chriſt did in both his Natures, not onely as he was man, but even as he was God: for in all the actions of Chriſt, you muſt not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Deitie from the Humanitie; (I pray obſerve it) there is no action of Chriſt would be of efficacie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſufficient for beleevers, if it were ſeparated from the concurrence of the Deitie: Therefore Chriſt as he was the ſecond perſon in the Trinitie, did give up himſelf to the obedience of the Law; thereupon is that, that it is called the righteouſneſſe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God without the Law is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the Law.</hi> What is meant by the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God?</hi> There is nothing meant but the obedience of Chriſt to the Law: Chriſt his perfect obedience to the Law is the <hi>righteouſneſs of God.</hi> Why is it called the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God? not only becauſe God found it out, but becauſe God wrought it, this white linnen garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, it is woven by no other then by God himſelf; it was the ſecond Perſon in Trinitie that wrought this righteouſneſſe, therefore it is called the righteouſneſſe of God. Not that the ſecond Perſon in Trinitie in himſelf obeyeth the Law of God, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but it is ſaid to be the righteouſneſſe of God, and ſo that God did obey the Law, becauſe the ſecond Perſon in Trinitie did fulfill all righteouſneſſe, and obey the Law; that nature which was the nature of the ſecond Perſon, wherein the ſecond Perſon in Trinitie did ſubſiſt; that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ſay, obeying the Law, the ſecond Perſon may bee ſaid to doe it; as the ſecond Perſon is ſaid to die, and God is ſaid to ſhed his bloud, becauſe that nature which obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law was the nature of God. The ſecond thing is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114897:11"/>a very great act, Chriſt thus as God and man <hi>gave himſelf</hi> up to the obedience of the Law for beleevers; Oh conſider and admire it! What a wonderful thing is this, that he that was the Law-giver, ſhould put himſelf to be under the Law for beleevers, and ſo become for them the Law-keeper.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, The laſt particular to which Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf</hi> for beleevers was to ſuffering, Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf</hi> to death for beleevers. Here for the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this you muſt know, That there are two kinds of ſufferings, to which the Lord Chriſt gave up himſelf for beleevers. Firſt, ſufferings in body. Secondly, ſufferings in ſoul: Firſt, the ſuffering of mans wrath. Secondly, the ſuffering of Gods wrath: Chriſt for beleevers gave up himſelf to both theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf</hi> up to the ſufferings in body, to the ſuffering of the wrath of man for beleevers; you that are acquainted with the Hiſtorie of the Goſpel know the truth of this. How did Chriſt ſuffer himſelf to bee ſcorned, to be hated, to be reviled, and perſecured by men? Chriſt he gave himſelf up in his paſſion; Firſt, to be arrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, attached by ſouldiers with ſtaves, and holberts as a malefactor: after that he gave himſelf up to be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his ears to be filled with blaſphemies, and with mocks, his face to be buffeted, to be ſpit upon, his head to be all wounded with thornes, his hands and his feet to be pierced with nails, and his ſide with a ſpear. Thus Chriſt gave up his body to the ſuffering of the wrath of man in bodily tortures, for beleevers; and in the laſt place, he gave himſelf up to the ſuffering of a diſſolution of ſoul and body, that which we call death. This is the firſt ſort of ſuffering to which Chriſt gave up himſelf for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, to the ſuffering of bodily tortures, to the ſuffering of the wrath of men. There is no kind of ſuffering that man is outwardly ſubject to, but Chriſt endured, in every member of his body, and in his name; his ears with their mocking ſpeeches, and his eyes with their mocking ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, when as they clothed him with purple, and gave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114897:11"/>him a reed in his hand, and bowed to him, and mocked him, calling him the King of the Jews by deriſion.</p>
                  <p>Again in the ſecond place, Chriſt he <hi>gave himſelf</hi> up to the ſufferings of ſoul, to the ſufferings of the wrath of God for beleevers, and this is a great deal more. Chriſt he did not only ſuffer in body, but he alſo ſuffered in ſoul. You may gather it from that in <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.32, 33, 34. <hi>He taketh with him</hi> Peter, James, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and began to be ſore ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and to be very heavie, and ſaith unto them, my ſoul is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowfull unto death;</hi> and afterward he goeth from them and prayeth three times, <hi>that if it were poſſible the cup might be taken from him.</hi> If ſo be that Chriſts ſuffering was only the wrath of men, and bodily tortures, Chriſt had been very puſillanimous, and faint-hearted, that would bee ſo fearfull at the apprehenſion of death. We have many men that can expect death without any amazement or fainting of heart, therefore if there had been no more then the bodily ſuffering, Chriſt had been weaker then men, who was thus amazed, and affrighted, and prayed three times <hi>that the Cup might paſſe from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further, that Chriſt ſuffered in ſoul wil appear by that in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. there ſaith the Text, <hi>Being in an agonie, he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of bloud falling to the ground.</hi> If Chriſt had only ſuffered in body, how had it been poſſible that the fear of death could have made him ſweat great drops of bloud: Many through fear have ſweat great drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but never any did ſweat drops of bloud, for never did any man feel ſuch a bloodie wrath as Chriſt felt at this time.</p>
                  <p>And yet further, in that <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.34. our Saviour ſaith it himſelf in expreſs termes, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto death;</hi> Here he ſaith plainly that his ſoul ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And likewiſe in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43. it is ſaid, That <hi>an Angel appeared to him from heaven ſtrengthning him:</hi> If Chriſt had nothing to doe, but ſuffer the death of his bodie, what need an Angel come to ſtrengthen him? Men are able to bear the apprehenſion of a bodily death,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114897:12"/>and ſhall we conceive Chriſt could not bear it without the ſtrengthning of an Angel?</p>
                  <p>Theſe things plainly ſhew, that Chriſt did not onely give himſelf up to the ſuffering of bodily wrath, but to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of ſoul, the ſuffering of the wrath of God; And it muſt be ſo, for if Chriſt had not ſuffered the wrath of God, as well as the wrath of man, Chriſt had never done beleevers any good at all, for the ſame nature that had ſinned muſt ſuffer; and the ſoul of beleevers ſinned, as well as the body, therefore the ſoul of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers muſt ſuffer as well as the body: The wrath of God is ſpirituall, and therefore reacheth the ſoul as well as the body, ſo that Chriſt could never have been a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to beleevers from the wrath of God, nor a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his juſtice, if the ſoul of Chriſt had not ſuffered the wrath of God, as well as his bodie the wrath of men.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the ſecond thing whereto Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for beleevers, and that was to the ſuffering both of man and of God, the tortures both of body and ſoul. And to the end you may a little better conceive it; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I beſeech you, what the tortures of ſoul and wrath of God is, that Chriſt gave himſelf up to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>It is (in brief) Firſt, a loſſe in regard of ſenſe of all the apprehenſion of Gods love, and a ſenſible feeling of the immortall, and eternall, and infinite wrath of God. The ſuffring of Gods wrath includeth theſe two things: A privation in regard of ſenſe of all the of favour God; and an enduring in regard of ſenſe of all the anger of God: theſe two things did Chriſt indure: Firſt, he loſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſenſe, all the apprehenſion of Gods favour; he had not the leaſt apprehenſion and ſenſe of the love, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, but even as the world is when the Sun is ſet, without all light; ſo was the ſoul of Chriſt in regard of ſenſe, without all love, without all favour, without all preſence of God at all, <hi>My God, my God, Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> In regard of ſenſe he ſuffered the loſſe of God, the loſſe of his love and favour, and this was more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114897:12"/>to Chriſt then a thouſand deaths. Indeed Chriſt had the favour and the love of God, but all ſenſe of it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly withdrawn.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt alſo ſuffered the full ſenſe of the wrath of God; the arrows of the divine diſpleaſure were ſhot in the ſpirit and ſoul of Chriſt. To be brief, this you muſt know, whatſoever beleevers ſhould have ſuffered for their ſins, whether it be in the loſſe of the ſenſe of Gods love, or in the ſenſible feeling of the wrath and divine diſpleaſure of Almightie God; all that Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo far as can be ſuffered without ſin, and without the guilt of a defiled conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Now to all this did Chriſt give up himſelf for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to the end that beleevers who have loſt the love of God might have it; Chriſt gave up himſelf in regard of ſenſe, for a while to loſe all ſenſe of Gods love, to the end that beleevers might not feel the inſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the infinite wrath of God, Chriſt took it upon him and endured it; and all this Chriſt did willingly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of his own accord, therefore the Phraſe in the Text is Emphaticall, <hi>Who gave himſelf,</hi> and Chriſt ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>I lay down my life.</hi> Beleevers did with full conſent ſin, Chriſt muſt with full conſent ſuffer, or elſe Chriſt could not deliver beleevers from the wrath of God. This appeareth, becauſe that Chriſt when hee knew that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray him, he goeth to that place where he was wont, and knew that <hi>Judas</hi> would come there. After that, <hi>Judas</hi> and the Souldiers come out of ſeek Chriſt, Chriſt cometh and offereth himſelf, <hi>Whom is it that you ſeek?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>We ſeek Jeſus of Nazareth; I am he,</hi> ſaith he, he offereth and declareth himſelf to them, putteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into their hands; and whereas he makes them to let all his Diſciples ſcape, yet he ſuffereth them to take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Could Chriſt make them let the Diſciples go, and could hee not have made them let himſelf go? Again, our Saviour did but ſpeak, <hi>and they went backward, and fell to the ground,</hi> he that could throw
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114897:13"/>them down backward, could be not have killed them with his word if he pleaſed? Again when <hi>Peter</hi> drew out his ſword, and went about to defend him, <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>put up thy ſword, I can pray to my Father, and hee ſhall preſently give me more then twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> One Angel in one night ſlew in the camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand men, and what then could twelve Legions of Angels have done? This Chriſt could have had for a word ſpeaking to his Father, but he did freely and willingly give up himſelf to all theſe torments for beleevers; and he did not onely ſuffer them as a man, but as a God: For as I told you in his obedience, ſo I tell you in his paſſion, you muſt not ſever the Divinitie of Chriſt from his humanitie; For howſoever the Godhead could not ſuffer, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Godhead did theſe things; it was the nature of Chriſt that ſuffered: Whatſoever a man doth with any part of himſelf, though it be with his bodie, the whole man is ſaid to doe it, becauſe all actions are attributed to the perſon, it was that nature that ſubſiſted in the Divine Perſon that endured all theſe things, therefore it is ſaid that God ſhed his bloud. Again, the Godhead did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it ſelf, and ſo had a hand in the paſſion of Chriſt, the Godhead did withdraw it ſelf from the revelation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of it ſelf to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Godhead did ſuffer it ſelf to be eclipſed, to be vail'd, to be obſcured, and ſo may have a hand in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Again the Godhead of Chriſt did ſupport the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, to bear the other wayes inſupportable wrath of God. But in all theſe reſpects the Lord Chriſt as God, as well as man, gave up himſelf to this for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
                  <p>Hence is that Emphaticall ſpeech, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Awake O ſword againſt my Shepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow.</hi> Obſerve that ſpeech, <hi>Awake O ſword,</hi> here God ſpeaks to his wrath, to his divine vengeance, to fall upon <hi>the man that is his fellow.</hi> Chriſt as Gods fellow did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114897:13"/>ſuffer the wrath of God, now Chriſt is not Gods fellow but as Chriſt is God: Chriſt as Gods fellow ſuffered the wrath of God, therefore Chriſt as God gave himſelf up even to ſuffer for beleevers. And obſerve the Phraſe, <hi>Awake O ſword, againſt the man that is my fellow,</hi> the very juſtice of God could not tel how to lay ſtroaks upon this Son of God til God bid it; it ſtood as it were in amazement for to ſtrike the man that was Gods own fellow: What, for God to ſtrike his fellow, that man that was God, how could juſtice doe this? Nay, juſtice could not till God bad it, <hi>Awake O ſword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you have ſeen the Doctrine opened to you, what the things are to which the Lord Chriſt freely diſpoſeth and bequeatheth himſelf for beleevers: To Incarnation, he that was God became man: To the obedience of the Law, he that was the Law-giver, became the Law-keeper: To ſuffering, both in body and in ſoul, both the wrath of man, and the wrath of God. This is the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Hee gave himſelf for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as briefly as I can to make ſome Uſe of the Point, and ſo to paſſe on to ſomewhat elſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, this Doctrine ſerveth to ſhew us the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love of Chriſt to beleevers. Can there be greater love then for a man to give himſelf to one? We count it the greateſt love that can be between creatures, that of the man to the wife, and the wife to the man, and why ſo? becauſe there is a giving themſelves one to another, which no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture elſe doth: This Chriſt hath done, he hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to beleevers, and he cannot ſhew greater love, becauſe he cannot do a greater thing, and yet behold a greater than this, he hath not only given himſelf to them, but for them, and that is a little more. You may conceive it by a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: If a man give himſelf to a woman to become her husband, there is a great-matter in that; but if the man ſhall give himſelf for the woman, when ſhee is to die, to die for her, that is more; he that giveth himſelf to her doth yet injoy himſelf, but he that giveth himſelf for her doth loſe himſelf; he that giveth himſelf to men hath himſelf, but hee
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114897:14"/>that giveth himſelf for men hath given away himſelf. Oh this, this is the love of Chriſt to all beleevers, <hi>He hath given himſelf for us,</hi> he that was God <hi>made himſelf of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> made himſelf nothing, for ſo the word is in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; he that was above the Law, he hath put himſelf under the Law; he that was a Soveraign, is become a Subject; he that was the God of life, is become a man under the power of death; he that was the Judge, ſtandeth as the perſon guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſuffereth the judgement: Here is his love, you that are beleevers, to the end that you might enjoy Gods favour, he hath given himſelf to loſe Gods favour for the ſenſe of it; to the end that you might never go to hell, he hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to endure the uttermoſt torments of hell: was there ever love like this? Suppoſe that Chriſt had given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to die ten thouſand times over and over again, a bodily death, it had not been in the leaſt degree ſo much as is one giving of himſelf ſome ſix hours to the enduring of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wrath of God. Here is the firſt Uſe, remember it, and admire it, and be overcome with the love of Chriſt; Oh that God would <hi>ſhed abroad this love in our hearts,</hi> would it not <hi>conſtrain us,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf?</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place as it ſerveth to ſhew the love of Chriſt, ſo it ſerveth for a great matter and ground of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and conſolation to you, that are beleevers, of having all from Chriſt whatſoever you ſtand in need of, for he hath <hi>given himſelf for you, and will he not give you all things elſe?</hi> What is it that your ſouls want? Do you deſire Chriſt? you ſhall certainly have Chriſt, he that hath given himſelf for thee, will he not give himſelf to thee? If we ſhall ſee a man giving of himſelf to death for a woman, ſhall we que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether that man will give himſelf as a husband to the woman? No certainly. So when thou ſeeſt alreadie that Chriſt hath given himſelf for thee, doeſt thou think Chriſt will not give himſelf to thee? when he gave himſelf for thee, he abaſed himſelf; when he giveth himſelf to thee, he exalteth himſelf: When he gave himſelf for thee, he was below his condition, when he giveth himſelf to thee, hee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114897:14"/>reſerveth his condition; for he giveth himſelf to be thy God and thy King, to be above thee, to command thee, therefore he that hath done the greater, will certainly doe the leſſer. And if Chriſt will give himſelf to thee, what elſe is there that thou wanteſt that Chriſt will not give thee? What Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in regard of God the Father, that may I ſpeak in regard of God the Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall hee not with him freely give us all things?</hi> So do I ſay, to all you that are beleevers, he that ſpared not himſelf, but gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for you, how much more ſhall hee freely with himſelf give you all things? Do you want the Spirit of Chriſt? He that hath given himſelf for you, will much more give his Spirit to you: It is more for Chriſt to give himſelf to you; then for Chriſt to give his Spirit to you; the Spirit is the Spirit of Chriſt, and he that hath given himſelf muſt needs give whatſoever he hath together with himſelf: The Spirit is but one of his Priviledges, and his Jewels, I mean the ſanctifying operations of the Spirit. If a man have given himſelf to a woman, will he not give her his name, his honour, his wealth, will he not give her all that he hath? Even ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and apply it for your comfort and aſſurance, he that hath given himſelf for you, will he not give you all that he hath? He that ſuffered the wrath of God to doe you good, will hee not ſanctifie your ſouls to doe you good? Hee that loſt his own peace for you, will hee not give you that peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which paſſeth all underſtanding. Thus it is a notable ground of ſtrong aſſurance confidently to perſwade our hearts of this, that there is nothing we want that is good for us, but Chriſt will give it us, who hath given himſelf for us.</p>
                  <p>Again thirdly, Let this be a motive ſtrongly to perſwade you to give up your ſelves to Chriſt; he hath given himſelf to you, will you not give up your ſelves to him? It is that which the Scripture often ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.13. <hi>Give up your ſelves as a reaſonable ſacrifice unto God.</hi> And again, <hi>Give up your members weapons of righteouſneſs unto God.</hi> Here now is an Argument above all Arguments, why ſhould you deny to give up your ſelves to him, who hath not denyed to give himſelf
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114897:15"/>to you? why ſhould you not give up your underſtandings, your naturall parts, to doe him ſervice? why ſhould you not give up your hearts to be poſſeſt by him? Why ſhould you not give up all the members of your bodies to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of doing his will, of furthering his honour, whereas he hath given up himſelf for you? There is a great difference between Chriſts giving himſelf for us, and between our gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up our ſelves to him. When Chriſt gave himſelf for us, he chang'd from the better to the worſe, when we give up our ſelves to Chriſt, we change from the worſe to the better; for till we give up our ſelves to Chriſt, we are the worlds, ſins, and the Divels, we are ſlaves, vaſſals, and drudges; then onely come we to be Lords, and to be Freemen, and to be happie, when we give up our ſelves to Chriſt. Now then if he have changed from the better to the worſer for your ſakes, will not you change from the worſer to the better for his ſake? Conſider this ſeriouſly, there is no argument in the world ſtronger to perſwade the ſoul to give up it ſelf to Chriſt, then to conſider this, that Chriſt hath given himſelf to us. Become Chriſts altogether, be not any longer the worlds, nor your own, but the Chriſts, and Chriſts altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; give up your names for Chriſt, be content the world ſhould take away your name for the ſake of the Goſpel of Chriſt; give up your goods for Chriſt; ſuffer even with joy the ſpoyling of your goods for the ſake of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel; give up your liberties for Chriſt, be content to be deprived of all your freedoms and contentments that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy for Chriſt; give up your lives for Chriſt, for he hath given up his life for you. And if all this, then much more give up your ſins for Chriſt: What doth Chriſt require of thee, that art a profaner <hi>of his day,</hi> but to abandon that ſin, to crucifie that ſin? Oh doe it! Chriſt hath given himſelf for thee; thou haſt a ſin perhaps that is neer and dear to thee; Chriſt calleth for it, Oh give it up to the ſword of his word, to be mortified, and crucified, he gave up his deareſt life for thee. Thus me thinks, this ſame is a notable motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to mortification, to die to ſin; and to vivification, to live to Chriſt, to devote our ſelves in every thing to the Lord
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114897:15"/>Jeſus. Let us not, let us not I beſeech you, live any longer to our ſelves but to Chriſt, who hath loved us, ſo as to give himſelf for us.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, (to conclude this point) let me perſwade all ſuch of you as are not yet beleevers, that you would labour above all things to become beleevers: Oh my brethren, thrice happie are they of whom this may be ſaid, <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelf for us:</hi> This is onely the happineſs of beleevers, they whoſe hearts are purified, they that have a working love, they that have a breſtplate that ſecures their ſouls againſt all the wounds of the world and ſin, they that have an overcoming and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious faith, they have this happineſs: You therefore that are not ſuch, labour to be ſuch, for if you are not beleevers, you have no benefit by Chriſt; it ſhall be to you as if Chriſt had never dyed: Is there any thing in the world that is able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt you in this gift but onely faith? Suppoſe you had never ſo much honour, will this bring you to be in the number of thoſe <hi>for whom Chriſt is given?</hi> Suppoſe you had never ſo much wealth, and good trading, health, and ſtrength of bodie, and the confluence of all other outward contentments, <hi>Will all this Intereſt you in the gift of Chriſt?</hi> No, no, Chriſt hath not given himſelf for worldlings, for thoſe that are loaden with honours and carnall pleaſures, and profits; he hath given himſelf for thoſe that have faith, and onely for them. As ever therefore you deſire to have an intereſt in this gift of Chriſt, labour to have in your ſouls this grace of Faith. Would it not do any one good to be in the number of thoſe who are ſo dear unto Chriſt, that for their ſakes he gave himſelf? There is no way to be in their number but to bee beleevers, Oh therefore above all minde this, to get the grace of faith, it is that one thing neceſſary, for they that are beleevers are the Perſons for whom Chriſt hath given himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have done with the two firſt Parts of the Text, the Action of Chriſt, <hi>He gave himſelf:</hi> Together with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof, <hi>For us,</hi> that is, for beleevers.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the End why Chriſt gave himſelf for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. And this is laid down in the latter part of the Verſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114897:16"/>
                     <hi>That he might redeem us from all iniquitie, and purifie unto himſelf a pecu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are two ends of this action of Chriſt, the one is Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, concerning them for whom he gave himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Beleevers, <hi>That he might redeem them from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> The other is, concerning himſelf, that he might <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Theſe are the two ends of Chriſts giving of himſelf, the one concerneth the good of his people; the other, the glory of himſelf: Here was the end of Chriſts Incarnation, of Chriſts obedience to the Law, of Chriſts ſuffering and paſſion, the glory of himſelf, and the good of his people. This was the end of all that Chriſt did, and theſe two are ever joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Chriſt, mans ſalvation, and Gods honour.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, we will begin with the firſt end, (which is all, I ſuppoſe, that we ſhall go through with at this time) and that is that which concerneth beleevers, <hi>that he might redeem us,</hi> (that is, us that are beleevers) <hi>from all iniquitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the opening of the words, We will ſhew you firſt of all, what is meant by <hi>iniquitie;</hi> and then ſecondly, What is meant by <hi>redeeming from all iniquitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, What is meant by <hi>iniquitie.</hi> The Word in the Original, it is Tranſgreſſion, <hi>That he might redeem us from all tranſgreſſion:</hi> It is a going beſide the Law, a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and breaking of the Law of God. It is well tranſlated <hi>iniquitie,</hi> for it is an evill, for the Law of God is onely good, and therefore going beſide the Law muſt be evill. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to God, diſhonourable to him, therefore it is called <hi>iniquitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet this tranſgreſſion of the Law, or <hi>iniquitie,</hi> as it is here called, it is to be taken largely, not only for the act of <hi>iniquitie,</hi> the act of breaking the Law, but for all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and for all the concomitants of it. The tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law with all the Effects of it, is here meant by <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> And therefore by <hi>iniquitie</hi> here are three things meant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, that which wee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114897:16"/>commonly call ſin, that is meant by <hi>iniquitie.</hi> Mat. 13.41. <hi>They ſhall gather out of his kingdome, all things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie,</hi> that is, them that tranſgreſſe the Law of God. There is one thing which is here meant by <hi>iniquitie,</hi> the violation of Gods ſtatutes, the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By <hi>iniquitie</hi> is meant alſo, that which followeth upon this, and that is guilt, that ſame guilt which cleaveth to the conſcience of a man, upon every tranſgreſſion of Gods Law. This is alſo meant by <hi>iniquitie,</hi> as you may gather from that in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I will be mercifull to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> What is here meant by <hi>Iniquitie?</hi> Not the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, for God cannot but remember that ever, for all things paſt as well as to come, are preſent before him: But by not remembring <hi>iniquity</hi> is meant this, I will not charge upon them the guilt of their iniquitie; I will acquit them from that judgement which by their <hi>iniquitie</hi> they are bound over to. So that here by <hi>iniquitie</hi> is meant that guilt which followeth the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By <hi>Iniquity</hi> is further meant, all that wrath which is deſerved by breaking of Gods Law, that which they are bound over to, by the guilt: all that judgement which juſtly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, and that is ſlaverie to Sathan, and the vengeance of God here and hereafter. This is alſo meant by Iniquitie, all temporall, ſpirituall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wrath, that righteouſly followeth upon the breach of Gods Law. Thereupon it is that you ſhall finde in <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Peter</hi> there ſpeaks to <hi>Simon Magus, I perceive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> Obſerve there, how they are joyned together, <hi>Gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bond of iniquitie;</hi> Why is the <hi>bond of iniquitie</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the gall of bitterneſs?</hi> Becauſe who ever is under <hi>iniquitie,</hi> they are in a gall of <hi>bitterneſs,</hi> they are under all the wrath which from God is due juſtly to ſinners, horror of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſlaverie to Satan, and temporall and eternall vengeance. Thus you ſee what is meant in the Text by <hi>iniquitie;</hi> Theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114897:17"/>three things, the breaking of Gods Law, the guilt which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon it, and all the judgements of God which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon that; plagues both temporall, and eternall.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing is, What is meant by <hi>redeeming them from all iniquitie:</hi> What it is to redeem, you are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; to redeem, it is by a ranſome to ſet a perſon free from that evill to which he is bound over, and ſo it is here to be underſtood, Chriſt by paying a ranſome ſetteth free beleevers, from all that miſerie to which they were bound by their <hi>Iniquitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words being thus explained, the Doctrine ariſing from them is this, That:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for beleevers for this end, that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming aranſome for them, he might ſet them free from all tranſgreſsion of the Law of God, from all guilt that followeth upon tranſgreſsion, and from all puniſhment that is due to the tranſgreſsion of the Law,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine you ſee is nothing elſe, but the very words of the Text explained; For the proof of it, you may pleaſe to conſider that name that is given to Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 47. <hi>The firſt man is of the earth, earthie; The ſecond man is the Lord from heaven.</hi> Chriſt here is called the ſecond man, what is the reaſon of it? Becauſe there is a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> onely it is a proportion of unlikeneſſe, and contrarietie, not a proportion of likeneſs and agrement; Chriſt is juſt contrary to the firſt man, how is that? The firſt man did bring all mankind under ſin, and guilt and puniſhment; Chriſt he doth bring all beleevers, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that doe beleeve in him, he bringeth them all from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, from under guilt, from under puniſhment: Thus there is a likeneſs between Chriſt and <hi>Adam,</hi> onely by way of contrarietie, Chriſt undoing what <hi>Adam</hi> did; Chriſt bringing our of all that miſerie into which <hi>Adam</hi> brought us: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt is called the Second Man, the firſt man undid us all, the Second hath made us all that are beleevers; the firſt man hath run us into debt, the Second hath redeemed us
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114897:17"/>from all that miſerie into which the firſt hath plunged us.</p>
                  <p>And not to prove this onely in generall, you ſhall ſee it proved in all the particulars, how that the Lord Chriſt hath been a ranſome, and ſetteth free all beleevers from all Iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, The firſt thing that I told you is meant by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie, it is the breaking, the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law: Now Chriſt he hath ſet beleevers free from this iniquitie, he hath delivered them from the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law: this is that you have in the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Foraſmuch as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as filver and gold, from your vain converſation, but with the precious blood of Chriſt:</hi> Obſerve, the precious blood of Chriſt doth redeem beleevers from their vain converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, from the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, from a courſe of diſobedience, and of breaking Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I pray obſerve it, it is a thing that the world thinks not of, Chriſt hath redeemed beleevers from the very breaking of Gods commandments from their vain converſation. It is true, beleevers are not yet perfectly free from all tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, yet notwithſtanding they are freed from a great deal which they were ſubject to before, which none doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but they that doe beleeve: for howſoever they cannot but ſin, yet notwithſtanding ſin doth not raign in them: though they are not delivered from the preſence of ſin, yet they are delivered from the power of ſin, as you have it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> Sin indeed it hath a being in beleevers, but yet notwithſtanding, it cannot ſo act and command them as it did formerly; they doe not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the Law of God with reſolution, with love, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; the tranſgreſſions of the Law of God which they fall into, they are their burthens, they are their ſhame, they are their grief, they are the things that they hate, and would not doe. Thus I ſay, in a great part, they are for the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the firſt kind of iniquitie, from the very violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114897:18"/>of the Law of God, and in due time they ſhall come per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to be delivered from all tranſgreſſions of Gods Law. And there fore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. when he cryeth our, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the bodie of this death?</hi> that is, from the power of ſin that is in mee, who ſhall deliver me from that Originall corruption whereby I am made to commit iniquitie, and to tranſgreſs Gods Law? He preſendy ſubjoyneth, <hi>I thanke God through jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I thank God, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath delivered me. We have a title to perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from all tranſgreſſion, and we have the beginnings of it, in that we are now delivered from the power, and raign, and dominion of all ſin. Thus you ſee the firſt thing proved, Chriſt hath delivered beleevers from the firſt kind of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that is, from the tranſgreſsion of the Law, ſo that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not reign in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath alſo delivered them from the guilt of ſin, as he hath in a great part delivered them from the acting of ſin. This is that you have <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>In whom wee have redemption through his bloud, the forgiveneſs of our ſins:</hi> Where ſin is forgiven, there all the guilt of ſin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; by the bloud of Chriſt, beleevers have their ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, therefore the guilt of their ſins is taken away, ſo that there is no guilt of any ſin committed by a beleever that lieth upon him, but he is as perfectly free from the guilt of any ſin whatſoever he hath committed, as a man is freed from debt by a diſcharge from the Creditor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt hath alſo redeemed beleevers from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all iniquitie, ſo that there is no puniſhment of iniquitie can fall upon any beleever: See this in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt jeſus,</hi> that is, to beleevers: Chriſt hath redeemed them from the curſe of the Law, therefore from all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that belongeth to the breaking of the Law. This the Apoſtle excellently ſetteth forth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Where as</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the offence of one,</hi> (that is the firſt <hi>Adam) judgement came upon all men to condemnation: So by the righteouſneſſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114897:18"/>of one,</hi> (that is, of Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.</hi> Obſerve it: All that are in Chriſt they have a free gift of juſtification, they are acquitted and diſcharged from all puniſhment of ſinne whatſoever. Indeed I am not of their minde that ſay, That God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver puniſheth his children for ſin, it is an abhominable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and contrary to the whole courſe of the Scriptures. But yet this I deſire you to obſerve, That though God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth beleevers for their ſin, yet there is no beleever that hath the puniſhment of ſin; For you muſt know, that there is a puniſhment for ſin, and a puniſhment of ſin; the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, that beginneth in the wrath of God, and endeth in eternall damnation; now no beleever hath this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Indeed for their ſins they are puniſhed, but not with a puniſhment of ſin, neither cometh their puniſhment from wrath, neither doth it end in hell; but all the puniſhment they have for ſin is a fatherly correcton, it is ſueh a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as whereby God cleareth his juſtice to the world, and makes it appear, that he is no cockering Fathe: It is ſuch a puniſhment whereby they are trained, fitted, and educated, for the Kingdome of heaven, to which Chriſt hath redeemed them; ſo that though God puniſheth them for ſin, yet hee never layeth upon them the compleat puniſhment of ſin, Chriſt hath redeemed them from the fruit of iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Doctrine opened, <hi>That Chriſt hath given himſelf as a ranſome, to redeem all beleevers from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the tranſgreſſion of the Law, from the guilt of ſin, and ſo from the puniſhment of all ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the further opening and unfolding of this excellent Point, conſider with me briefly theſe four particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That all beleevers, they are by nature under all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, when the Text ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt gave himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them from all iniquitie:</hi> This implieth that beleevers were under all iniquitie, what need Chriſt give himſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them from that under which they were not? You ſhall finde this evidently declared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>By one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114897:19"/>all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2. 3. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of beleevers, he ſaith of them, as well as of others, that they were <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> and that they <hi>are by nature the children of wrath as well as others,</hi> and that they were in <hi>time paſt,</hi> acted by the Divell, and <hi>walked after the courſe of the world, according to the Prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that now worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience;</hi> And again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>all the world is become guiltie before God;</hi> all men by nature, as well belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as unbeleevers are all under iniquitie: Firſt, they are under the tranſgreſſion of the Law, they break the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God continually. Secondly, they are under the guilt of that tranſgreſſion, for he that hath the ſin muſt have the guilt. Thirdly, they are under the puniſhment that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the breakers of the Law, for he that committeh ſin, and hath the guilt thereof, muſt needs be lyable to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p>Here is the firſt thing conſiderable, Chriſt gave himſelf to redeem beleevers from all Iniquitie, therefore they are by nature under all iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered is, How beleevers come to be under all iniquitie. To this I anſwer, that they are born under the power of iniquitie. <hi>Pſal</hi> 51. 5. <hi>Behold, I was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquitie,</hi> (ſaith a beleever, that is <hi>David,) and in ſin did my mother warm mee;</hi> they were warmed in ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in iniquitie; and the Apoſtle in the place before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. telleth us that we that are beleevers, were all by <hi>nature the children of wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, Whence is it that beleevers come to bee born under iniquitie, vaſſals to ſin, ſlaves to Sathan, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the wrath of God? whence cometh this?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, (and that in a word onely) it cometh thus, by their firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> for all mankinde was in <hi>Adam,</hi> in his loynes, and <hi>Adam</hi> in innocencie repreſented all mankind, he ſtood (as a Parliament man doth for the whole country) for all that ſhould be born of him; ſo that look what <hi>Adam</hi> did, all his poſterity did: Now <hi>Adam</hi> broke the Commandment
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114897:19"/>of God, eating that fruit God had forbidden him to eat off; he breaking this Commandment, all his poſteritie brake it, upon the breaking of the commandment there cometh a guilt upon him, the guilt that came upon him came upon all that were in him, and ſo upon all mankind; upon the guilt, God layeth a puniſhment for ſin: What is that? to withdraw that Image of holineſs and righteouſneſſe wherein he was created, and to leave him to a contrary Image of unholineſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe; that was the puniſhment that God laid upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and this puniſhment God layeth upon all the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe they were as truly guiltie of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; as he was, whence it commeth, that all that are born of <hi>Adam</hi> are guiltie of eating the forbidden fruit; being guilty of that, the puniſhment that is laid upon that ſin is laid upon them, that holineſſe and righteouſneſſe wherein they were once (in <hi>Adam</hi>) created, is taken from them, and they are left to a contrary Image of Sathan, an image of unholineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe: Whence it cometh to paſſe, that they are all born under the guilt of ſin, under the power of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption, ſlaves to Sathan, and the objects of divine wrath. Thus you ſee the ſecond thing, how it cometh to paſſe that all beleevers are under all iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is, How Chriſt cometh to redeem belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from all this iniquitie; how Chriſt by giving of himſelf, could redeem beleevers from all iniquitie?</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you obſerve it; Chriſt did it thus. Becauſe that which brought beleevers under iniquitie, (as you have heard) was the breaking of Gods Law, Chriſt he cometh and fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Law of God, and he ſuffereth all that which the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God thought due for the breach of his Law: And ſo Chriſt doing that which beleevers ſhould have done, namely, to keep the Law; and ſuffering that which beleevers had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by their ſins, Chriſt doing and ſuffering this in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of beleevers, that is in mans nature, ſo that the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſinned, ſuffered; the ſame nature that was bound to keep the Law, did keep the Law in Chriſt; hence it cometh to paſſe, that Chriſt giving God the full price for their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114897:20"/>he cometh to redeem them from all iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>And that you may yet the better ſee that Chriſt by this act of his, giving himſelf thus to be a man, to obey all the Law, and to ſuffer all the wrath of God due to ſin, that he did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay the price that might ranſome all beleevers, conſider but in brief theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God and Chriſt made a compact, or a covenant toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; God offereth Chriſt this (who was the ſecond perſon in Trinitie) that he would become man, and in mans nature fulfill the Law, and ſuffer all that wrath of God that was due for the breach of this Law; God promiſed Chriſt that hee ſhould acquit and diſcharge all ſuch as beleeved in him. Chriſt he agreeth to this Covenant, and undertakes it, after the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made, he came and performed it; he became man and gave a perfect price, for the full payment of what ever was due, God abated him not a farthing, the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which beleevers were condemned to pay, hee paid it, he perfectly kept the law, he perfectly ſuffered the uttermoſt of all that wrath of God that was due to ſin.</p>
                  <p>And all this was done by Chriſt who was God, all this was done by the Second Perſon in Trinitie; ſo that now the perſon obeying the Law of God was infinitely better, then the perſons breaking the Law of God, the perſon that did ſuffer the wrath of God, was infinitely better then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhould have ſuffered the wrath of God; for they were but men, but this was the very Son of God: So that now God ſatisfieth God, God paid the ranſome to God, therefore the ranſome cannot but be compleat. And thus cometh Chriſt by giving of himſelf fully paying a price to redeem from all iniquitie, all them for whom he paid it, that is, all that doe beleeve in him. It is in this caſe, as if a man were in priſon for a great deal of monie, and a friend of that mans ſhould agree with his creditor, that upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he would diſcharge the man, and let him out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he would pay him the full debt; If the creditour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this offer, and the partie perform the condition, the poor man is acquitted and diſcharged. Even thus it is, God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114897:20"/>the Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt agreed, that upon Chriſts paying of all that which was due to God from all thoſe for whom he paid it, they ſhould be diſcharged, Chriſt he did it, and ſo they are ſet free. Thus you ſee how it cometh to paſſe, that Chriſt by giving himſelf, hath ſet free all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from all iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for the full clearing of this point, conſider the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Chriſt ſhould thus pay this price for beleevers, why Chriſt ſhould give himſelf to redeem beleevers from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. There are two reaſons of it. The one in reſpect of God, the other in reſpect of beleevers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In reſpect of God: Chriſts love to God made him doe it. Beleevers they are the elect and choſen of God, choſen by him to a kingdom. Now to the end they might come to the kingdom to which God hath choſen them, they muſt be redeemed from Iniquitie; they cannot redeem themſelves, therefore they muſt lie there: Chriſt out of love to God the Father, that he might bring to happines, thoſe whom God hath choſen to happines, he offereth himſelf and undertakes the work. This is that you have in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8. the Apoſtle there brings in Chriſt ſpeaking to God the Father, <hi>When he cometh into the world,</hi> (that is, when Chriſt was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,) he ſaith, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me; In burnt offerings and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for ſin, thou haſt no pleaſure, Then ſaid I, lo I come (in the volume of thy book, it is written of me) to doe thy will O God.</hi> God had appointed Chriſt to ranſome beleevers, Chriſt knowing it to be Gods will, out of his love to God, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offereth himſelf to doe it, ſo that here is the firſt reaſon in obedence to God, out of love to God, that he might deliver his elect, and bring them to that happineſs to which God hath choſen them, he giveth himſelf to redeem them from all iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is, From Chriſts love to beleevers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers as they were the choſen of God, ſo they were the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of Chriſt. The Lord Chriſt had a ſpeciall affection to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers upon three grounds. Firſt, Becauſe they were Gods
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114897:21"/>choſen, and Chriſt loving God, could not chuſe but love them. Secondly, becauſe they were his own choſen, for he hath choſen them as well as God the Father. Thirdly, Becauſe by God the Father they were given to him, as hee himſelf ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me.</hi> Upon theſe three grounds Chriſt loveth beleevers, now loving of them, Chriſt could not but pitty them in their miſerie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having it in his power, he ſetteth himſelf to bring them out, and ſo giveth himſelf a ranſome to redeem them from all iniquitie; ſo you have it <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your wives, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it;</hi> by the Church is meant the company of beleevers, his love to them is ſaid to be the cauſe of his giving himſelf for them. Thus by theſe things you have ſeen the Doctrine cleared and opened, That Chriſt gave himſelf for that end, that he might become a ranſome, and ſet free beleevers from all iniquitie, from the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and from the guilt of that tranſgreſſion, and from the punſhment that belonged to that guilt.</p>
                  <p>To make now ſome Uſe of this Point, and ſo to conclude, This Doctrine my brethren, is wonderfull ſweet and uſefull, and therefore I have been ſomewhat the longer, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and explaining thereof. It ſerveth both for Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Exhortation, and Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, here is wonderfull ſweet conſolation to all you that are beleevers, you that have a faith purifying your hearts, a faith working by love, a faith as a breſtplate, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth in you a conjugall affection to Chriſt from all the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteties of the world, fleſh, and Devill; you that have a faith overcomming the world, to you I ſpeak, you are thoſe happy ones for whom Chriſt gave himſelf, to redeem you from all iniquitie, to redeem you from the power of ſin, from the guilt of ſin, from the puniſhment of ſin. Be therefore of good comfort, thou that art a beleever, thou ſhalt certainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all iniquitie. Hath Chriſt given himſelf for this end, and is not attainable? It were folly in Chriſt to give himſelf for an end which is not attainable; No my brethren,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114897:21"/>hath Chriſt given himſelf for it, and ſhall it not be done? If this be the end for which Chriſt gave himſelf, then either this end is made good, or elſe Chriſt is diſappointed of his end.</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible (thinkſt thou) for Chriſt to redeem thee from all iniquitie? Oh yes, Chriſt hath made the world, he hath conquered hell, the Devill, and the grave, therefore Chriſt can doe this. If it be poſſible for Chriſt to doe it, then Chriſt will doe it, for it was the very end why he gave himſelf. Doeſt thou think Chriſt hath been at ſo much coſt and pains, that he hath coveted thy redemption ſo ſtrongly, that he hath not ſpared himſelf, but given himſelf for this end, to redeem thee from all iniquitie, and will not Chriſt effect it? Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, and be aſſured of it, ſeeing it is the very end for which Chriſt gave himſelf, the thing ſhall be done.</p>
                  <p>Thou that art a beleever, thou art alreadie redeemed in a great meaſure from all iniquitie, thou art redeemed from the power and dominion of ſin, thou art no longer a ſervant of ſin, thou art now a ſervant of righteouſneſſe: thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready redeemed from the guilt of all ſin, there is no ſin God will ever charge upon thee to thy condemnation; thou art already delivered from the puniſhment belonging to ſin: Oh take comfort in that redemption thou already haſt and rejoyce under hope in that which is to come; the time is coming and ſhall aſſuredly be, when thou ſhalt be perfectly redeemed from all iniquitie. Thou art now freed from the power of ſin, the time is coming in which thou ſhalt be freed from the preſence of ſin.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Chriſt he hath now ſo ordered it, that God in his juſtice is tyed to deliver thee from all iniquitie, for he hath paid the price, therefore God muſt ſet thee free. God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with Chriſt that if he would pay the full price for the redemption of beleevers they ſhould be diſcharged? Chriſt hath paid the price, God muſt be unjuſt, or elſe hee muſt ſet thee free from all iniquitie. Oh comfort thy ſelf therefore with this. What <hi>Moſes</hi> once ſaid to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I may ſpeak to thee that art a beleever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14 13.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114897:22"/>
                     <hi>Moſes ſaid to the people, Fear not, ſtand ſtill, ſee the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, which he will ſhew you this day,</hi> What is that? <hi>For the Egyptians whom you have ſeen to day, you ſhall ſee them again no more for ever.</hi> This was typicall, this was a type of Chriſts redeeming thee that art a beleever from all iniquitie: I ſay therefore to thee, ſtand ſtill, and fear not, be not afraid of any thing; art thou invirond round about with iniquities, as they were with the Egyptians, fear not, ſtand ſtill, be but patient a little, ſoon ſhall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he time come wherein thou ſhalt ſee the ſalvation of the Lord; for thine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities whom thou now ſeeſt, thou ſhalt fee them again no more for ever. This is the very end of Chriſts dying, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this end ſhall be made good: Oh let us rejoyce together in the redemption of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>How would it glad our ſoul, if we were vaſſalized to the Turk, or ſlaves to the Moors to be redeemed from that vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and ſlaverie? If we were to be impriſoned but all our life time for a debt which we could never pay, how would it rejoyce our ſoul, if a friend ſhould come and pay our ranſome, and diſcharge our debt, and ſet us free? Behold here, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a greater redemption wrought for thee by Chriſt; thou art redeemed from under all iniquitie, not with a temporarie redemption; thou mayeſt be redeemed in thy body from a ſlave, and taken captive again the next yeer; thou mayeſt be redeemed out of priſon for debt, and brought in again ſoon after; but the redemption thou haſt by Chriſt, it is an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall redemption,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. an <hi>univerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> it is from all iniquitie, and it is for ever. Here is the firſt Uſe, Admirable conſolation to all beleevers, you that are not ſenſible of this comfort are not beleevers. Chriſt hath given himſelf for this end to redeem us from all iniquitie, therefore aſſuredly his end ſhall be effected, all beleevers ſhall be freed from all iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>The Second Uſe is for Exhortation: Is this the end why Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf, to redeem us from all iniquitie;</hi> then let us that are beleevers, be exhorted to theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, let us be afraid of coming under any Iniquitie.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114897:22"/>The Lord Chriſt did ſo much deſire our redemption from all iniquitie, That he gave himſelf for that end; Oh then let us bee afraid of being again brought under the power of any iniquitie. Hath Chriſt ſo much deſired our freedome from Iniquitie, as that he gave himſelf for that end, and ſhall not we have a care, that Chriſt may have his deſire, in keeping our ſelves free from iniquitie? Suppoſe a Father had been content to redeem his ſon out of priſon (wherein he was perpetually to lie for debt) to ſell all that he had, and to ſtrip himſelf of all his eſtate to ſet his ſon free; ſhould we not cry out of that ſon, that ſhould after that he was redeemed ſo coſtly by his father, again turn Prodigall? It is as groſſe a thing (my brethren) for us that are redeemed by Chriſt with ſo coſtly a Redemption, as is even the giving of himſelf, to ruſh again under the power of that iniquitie, from which to redeem us, Chriſt hath given himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a father ſhould ſo love a ſon, as that for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and freeing of him from a diſeaſe, he ſhould ſhed his own hearts bloud; ſhould we not judge it abhominable for that ſon preſently to run again into the infection of the ſame diſeaſe, when as his father with ſo much love and coſt, even his own life had procured his freedome from the diſeaſe? I beſeech you conſider it, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given himſelf to be a man, to obey the Law, to ſuffer the wrath of God, and to die, that we might be redeemed from iniquitie; Oh therefore let us ever be fearful of coming under iniquitie any more, let us not ſuffer our ſelves to be defiled with that ſin, from which to deliver us, Chriſt hath given himſelf. Certainly if any argument in the world would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade people not to given way to ſin, but <hi>to deny ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly in this preſent world,</hi> this will doe it.</p>
                  <p>When therefore thou art tempted to commit a ſin, reaſon thus with thy ſelf. Now that I am tempted to ſin, here is preſented to me, pleaſure, or honour, or profit, or eſcape from trouble, and if I will commit the ſin, I ſhall attain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe; but let me remember, that to the end I might
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114897:23"/>bee brought out of ſin, <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf:</hi> Is not Chriſt more worth than profit? more worth than pleaſure? of more worth then my life? why then to ſave my ſelf from danger, or to gain profit, or pleaſure, or honours, ſhould I ruſh into a ſinne, out of which, Chriſt to pluck me, hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Conſider of it, for this I aſſure you, that there are none whom Chriſt hath redeemed from Iniquitie, but he doth put into them ſuch a ſpirit, that they ſhall for ever after bee carefull to keep themſelves from iniquitie. The Lord Chriſt would not bee at ſo great coſt to give himſelf for an end that ſhould be fruſtrate, he hath bought our redemption with the price of himſelf, therefore he will make it ſure that it ſhall be effected. If therefore you find your hearts bold to run into any ſin, and ready to put your ſelves into all iniquitie, you are not thoſe that are redeemed by Chriſt. Conſider for the proof of this, theſe places, <hi>James</hi> 1.27. <hi>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to viſit the fatherleſſe and widowes in their affliction, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world.</hi> Obſerve it, where there is a true Religion, there men keep themſelves from the ſpots of the world. And you ſhall finde this alſo excellently and plainly laid down in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. from the 6. <hi>verſe</hi> to the 11. <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him</hi> (that is, in Chriſt) <hi>ſinneth not, whoſoever ſinneth hath not ſeen him, neither known him; Little children, let no man deceive you, he that doth righteouſneſſe is righteous,</hi> but in <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>He that committeth ſin, is of the devill.</hi> Obſerve theſe Phraſes of the Scripture: And in <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and be cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> And in <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the devill, whoſoever doth not righteouſneſſe, is not of God.</hi> In few words, here is a plain tryall who are Gods, and who are the Devils children; whoever ſinneth, whoever doth not righteouſneſſe is of the Devill, is not of God: Take notice of it, I beſeech you, they are the very words of the Spirit of God. And to this you may adde that in the fifth Chapter of the ſame
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114897:23"/>Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> v. 18. <hi>We know that whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not, but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> All theſe places plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, That whoſoever Chriſt hath redeemed from under iniquitie, he ſo works with them, that they ſhall never return to iniquitie again; for Chriſt gave himſelf to free them from it, and he will never buy a thing at ſo coſtly a rate but it ſhall be done. Not, but that they that are redeemed, ſin; but the meaning is, They never commit ſin with a full conſent, they never again come under the power and reign of ſin; ſin they doe, but it is out of infirmitie, it is not with purpoſe of heart, it is not with deliberation, it is not with delight; when ever they ſin they doe that which they hate, and they commit that which they hate, and they commit that which they are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of. This is the meaning of theſe Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſay, be exhorted, ſeeing Chriſt hath ſo dearly bought your redemption from all iniquitie; Oh in the name of Chriſt be exhorted, neither for pleaſure, nor for honour, nor for fear, neither to pleaſe your ſelves, nor the world, nor your friends, never be brought under any iniquitie, for Chriſt gave himſelf for this end, to redeem us from all iniquitie. This is the firſt exhortation, to exhort us to take heed of coming under any iniquitie, ſeeing to redeem us from it, Chriſt gave himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Exhortation is, to exhort us to labour every day more and more to get from under that iniquitie under which we are. The former Exhortation exhorted us to keep our ſelves from coming under that from which we are gotten; this is to exhort us, to labour every day more and more to get from under that iniquitie, under which we are: For did Chriſt give himſelf for this end, Oh then let us never give over till we are gotten from under all iniquitie. What end can we better aim at, then Chriſt aimed at, the redeeming us from all iniquitie? let us alſo aim at this, to redeem our ſelves from all iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is true, in the point of ſatisfaction, and in the point of paying the ranſome, we can do nothing, Chriſt doth all, but yet this I muſt tell you, that in the point of deliverie of our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114897:24"/>ſelves from under iniquitie, we muſt doe a great deal. Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us right to come out from under all iniquitie, but Chriſt requireth that we our ſelves ſhould bring our ſelves from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der iniquitie. It is true indeed, we cannot doe it, but by Chriſt, it is the grace of Chriſt, the power of Chriſt, the ſpirit of Chriſt that doth help us to get our ſelves from under iniquitie; yet notwithſtanding we muſt labour to get our ſelves from under it, and Chriſt will help us. For this I might quote many places, but for fear of being too long, I will content my ſelf with that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, doarly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Obſerve the Phraſe, the Apoſtle doth not ſay be cleanſed, but let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit. But ſome might ſay, we are cleanſed already, Chriſt hath cleanſed us. Yea ſaith the Apoſtle in part, but we muſt perfect this holineſs; Chriſt hath brought us from under iniquitie in ſome meaſure, now Chriſt expects we ſhould bring our ſelves from under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>It is in this caſe as it was with the people of Iſrael, it was the Lords power and gift that gave them poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was the Almightie arm of God that did it: Yet notwithſtanding when they were in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were fain to fight for it, before the <hi>Cananites</hi> were diſpoſſeſt: that was but a Type of this: It is the Lords Almighty power that hath poſſeſt us with this libertie and freedome from iniquitie, but yet notwihſtanding before we can come to inioy a full libertie from all iniquitie, we muſt fight for it, and wage the battels of the Lord. And truly (my brethren) Chriſtians are miſerably guiltie of being under the power of iniquitie, much more then they might, becauſe they are lazie, and idle, and they doe not labour to deliver themſelves from under the remainders of iniquitie; but even as it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> (which were but a type of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers) in <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I ſaid unto you, you ſhall make no league with the inhabitants of this land, you ſhall throw down their Altars, but you have not obeyed my voice.</hi> The Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114897:24"/>the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould never leave till they had rooted out the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but they were lazie, and idle, and did not drive out ſo many as they might. Even thus it is with moſt Chriſtians, the Lord hath poſſeſt us of libertie, and yet he requireth that we ſhould work out the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of iniquitie; wee are generally lazie, and we make leagus with ſin, and we have a ſecret affection to this luſt, or to that luſt, and therefore we doe not beſtir our ſelves laboriouſly to expell all iniquitie. Here is the reaſon that the end of Chriſt is no more made good unto us.</p>
                  <p>Oh be now exhorted I beſeech you, to fulfill the deſire of Chriſt, it was the very end why he died, that thou ſhouldſt be redeemed from all iniquity; be thou like Chriſt, doe thou make corruption die, that thou mayeſt redeem thy ſelf from all iniquitie. This is the very ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Text; he had exhorted in the beginning of the Chapter, ſervants to their duties, maſters to theirs, old men and women to theirs; all to <hi>deny ungodlineſs and worldy luſts, and to live ſoberly and righteouſly in this preſent world:</hi> Now to perſwade them to this, he bringeth in this of the Text, for (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for this end, to redeem us from all iniquitie:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, will you not make good the end of Chriſt? when Chriſt had ſo much deſired to redeem you from all iniquitie, that to effect it, he hath given himſelf: what will you not beſtir your ſelves to make good this end of Chriſt? Oh be exhorted to endeavour the purging away the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>We have now finiſhed the Uſes of Exhortation, we are now laſtly to come to ſome Uſes of Inſtruction, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine (my brethren) <hi>That Chriſt gave himſelf for this end, to redeem us from all iniquitie,</hi> it ſerveth for a threefold Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, to teach us, that there is no need of any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on our parts to appeaſe the wrath of God, or deliver us from our iniquities, for Chriſt hath given himſelf to doe it; therefore it is but a ſillie thing to thinke that wee can come
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114897:25"/>after and doe it. The very thing whereby men ſhould ſatisfie Gods wrath, Chriſt hath given himſelf to doe it. There is but two waies men can ſatisfie the juſtice and wrath of God: The one is, by keeping the Law: The other is, by ſuffering the wrath of God due for the breaking of the Law. To doe both theſe, the Lord Chriſt hath given himſelf; and if Chriſt have certainly done it, what need men come after to add any thing to it? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a Doctrine of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and it telleth us, That men muſt ſatisfie in this life, and after this life. All this is needleſſe and derogatorie to Jeſus Chriſt, as if men ſhould come after and adde any thing to what he hath done, as if the redemption of Chriſt were not perfect, as if Chriſts giving of himſelf were not enough to redeem us from all iniquitie. Learn this therefore, that ſo you may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that Doctrine, and here is the firſt inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, to teach us the great bondage and ſlavery that iniquitie holdeth them in that are under it; for if ſo be that Chriſt gave himſelf to fetch beleevers out of iniquitie, then certainly it is a miſerable thing to be under iniquitie. It were a ſilly thing that Chriſt ſhould be at ſo much coſt as to give himſelf to free beleevers from iniquitie, if it were not a miſerable thing for beleevers to be under iniquitie, the very Phraſe teacheth us that it is a bondage to be under ſin, he gave himſelf to redeem us from iniquitie, therefore to bee under iniquitie is a bondage, for redemption ſuppoſeth a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie. Oh it is a bondage indeed, and a ſlaverie worſe then that of the Turks or Moors.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, the ſlaverie of the Turk is but of the bodie, but the ſlaverie to ſin is of the bodie and ſoul both. The ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Turk is but to men, the ſlaverie to ſin, is a ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Devill. The ſlaverie to the Turk is but for a while, at the longeſt but for a mans life, but the ſlaverie to ſin is for ever. Again, the ſlaverie to the Turk, a man may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from it, by ſome ordinary price, by a certain ſum of Gold and Silver; but the ſlaverie to ſin a man can never be freed out of that, but by the precious bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Yee were not redeemed from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114897:25"/>your vain converſation</hi> (redemption from ſins ſlaverie is not attainable) <hi>by ſilver and gold, and corruptible things; but by the precious bloud of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi> Blood muſt be ſhed, before freedome from the ſlaverie from ſin can be attained, and the bloud of one that is innocent, and the blood of one that is the Son of God. Oh what a ſlaverie is this, our of which nothing can redeem but blood, innocent blood, even the blood of the Son of God. Certainly either it is an infinite miſerie to be under ſins ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, or Chriſt was very fooliſh to give ſuch an infinite price to redeem us from it. For what is it for Chriſt to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for Chriſt to give an infinite price? For is not Chriſt God, whom the Angels worſhip, who made the world? Chriſt gave himſelf to redeem people, therefore it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite miſerie under which they are, or he had been infinitely unwiſe, to give ſo great a price. Learn then, That Chriſt gave himſelf to redeem from ſin, therefore ſin is an infinite bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſlaverie; give no reft therefore to your ſouls till you come out of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, Hath Chriſt given himſelf for this end? Oh then let all that are beleevers know, that is their duty to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now I ſhall ſpeak to all of you, for there is none of you but ſay you are beleevers, there is none of you but think that Chriſt gave himſelf for you. Is there any of you here preſent, that doe not think Chriſt gave himſelf for you? If you did not thinke ſo, you would deſpair preſently. If you doe thinke ſo, ſee your dutie, hath Chriſt given himſelf to ranſome you, oh then what a love do you owe to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Conſider but theſe particulars in Chriſts giving of himſelf for your ranſome.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he hath given a great price, he hath given himſelf for our ranſome, it is the moſt coſtly ranſome, that ever friend gave to ranſome a friend: Many men have given money, but Chriſt hath given himſelf to redeem you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a perfect ranſome, he hath redeemed you from all iniquitie.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:114897:26"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is a perpetuall ranſome, he hath for ever redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med you.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is an undeſerved ranſome. What did you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when Chriſt gave himſelf to ranſome you from ſin? you were enemies to Chriſt, you hated him, you perſecuted him, you rejected him. There is no nation in the world ſo bitter an enemie to our nation, as you were to Chriſt when he gave himſelf to ranſome you.</p>
                  <p>On then behold a coſtly ranſome, a perfect ranſome, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ranſome, an underſerved ranſome! What doth this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve but wonderfull love at your hands? If there were a man that were to lie in priſon all his life long for debt, and one ſhould come to him that he never knew, of whom hee never deſerved any kindneſſe; if this man ſhould ſet him free, how would he love that man? and truly, there were great cauſe that he ſhould. Suppoſe a man were a ſlave to the Turk, and there for ought he knew he was to ſpend all his dayes in that drudgerie, and a man comes and payes an exceeding great ranſome even as much every farthing as is deſired; would that man that is thus redeemed thinke it too much to be a ſervant to him that ſet him free? No ſurely, I remember what the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid once to <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Rule thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, both thou and thy ſon, and thy ſons ſon, for thou haſt delivered us out of the hand of Midian.</hi> Becauſe he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them, they give their Crown and Scepter to him, and to his poſteritie for divers generations, and <hi>Gideon</hi> deſerved it. Theſe perſons ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt you that will not love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Never did any Creditor, never did any redeemer that ranſomed a ſlave from drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, never did this <hi>Gide on</hi> doe half ſo much for them, as Chriſt hath done for you. They did not give themſelves, Chriſt hath given himſelf, and that to redeem you from iniquitie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the work is of infinite worth, ſo your love ſhould be abundant.</p>
                  <p>Oh love Chriſt therefore above all, above your ſins, above the world, above your friends, above your liberties, above your goods, above your lives, for he hath loved you above his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114897:26"/>life, he hath given himſelf to redeem you from all iniquitie. let it be ſaid of you as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe beleevers in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom though yee ſee not, yet yee love,</hi> though you ſee not Jeſus Chriſt yet love him, for he hath done theſe things for you.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall you be aſſured that you are in the number of them for whom Chriſt gave himſelf to redeem from all iniquitie?</p>
                  <p>If you finde your ſouls to love the Lord Chriſt above all things; but on the other ſide, if you doe not finde your hearts loving Chriſt above all things, if you cannot ſay of Chriſt as the Church in the <hi>Canticles, Oh thou whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> if you cannot ſay that Chriſt hath more room in your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there is more inlargement of heart toward him, then to any thing elſe in the world, then you are not yet in the number of them for whom Chriſt gave himſelf to redeem them from all iniquitie: Therefore, I beſeech you, quicken up your hearts towards Chriſt. Why doth Iniquitie ſo abound now, and the love of ſo many waxe cold? Surely, you have forgotten your ſelves, have not you forgotten what Chriſt hath done? how elſe could your affections be ſo little, ſo cold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him? Remember what I have opened now unto you, Chriſt gave himſelf to be a man, to obey the Law, to ſuffer the wrath of God and man, and that for this end, <hi>to redeem you from all iniquitie,</hi> therefore love you the Lord Jeſus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he doth deſerve. And thus much ſhall ſerve for the firſt end, Why Chriſt gave himſelf for beleevers: That end which concerns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers themſelves, <hi>Viz. That he might redeem them from all iniquitie:</hi> The Second remaineth, and that is that which concernes himſelf. But ſo much for this Time. (⁂)</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having in the firſt verſe of this preſent Chapter, in the very firſt words of the Verſe ſet down the bleſſed Priviledges of all true beleevers, ſuch as are regenerated and are in Chriſt, he doth afterwards in many Verſes lay down the Signs and Tryals, whereby he doth diſcover who they bee that are in that bleſſed condition, and who they bee that are not: And amongſt others (not to ſtand upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, it not being neceſſary for the underſtanding of this Verſe) he doth in the words of the Text, lay down certain cleer Signs and Tryals, whereby people may know whether they are regenerated by Chriſt, and ſo juſtified, yea or no; And that is the Scope and Sum of this Verſe, <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead, becauſe of ſin; but the Spirit is life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Verſe then you have theſe two things conſiderable:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ſtate and condition of all juſtified perſons; Chriſt is in them: in the firſt words, <hi>If Chriſt be in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:114897:29"/>
                  <p>Secondly, the Signs and Evidences whereby it may bee known, whether Chriſt be in people yea or no; in the reſt of the Verſe; <hi>the bodie is dead, becauſe of ſin; but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the Firſt, The ſtate and condition of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are juſtified: <hi>They have Chriſt in them. If Chriſt be in you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, ſuppoſing thus much, <hi>That the Lord Chriſt is in every juſtified perſon, in every one that is exempted from condemnation.</hi> The Point is clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the words of the Text, <hi>If Chriſt be in you:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like to this you have <hi>John</hi> 14.20. <hi>I am in my Father</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples) <hi>and you in me, and I in you:</hi> They are in him, and he in them. The like alſo you have <hi>John</hi> 17.21,—23. There our Saviour prayeth, <hi>That they may be one in us, I in them, and thou in mee, that they may bee made perfect in one.</hi> Mark: <hi>I in them, and thou in me,</hi> Look as God the Father is in Chriſt, ſo the Lord Chriſt alſo is in every beleever. To this purpoſe alſo is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>The riches of the glory of this myſterie is, Chriſt in you the hope of glory: CHRIST IN YOU.</hi> You ſee the Point is clear: <hi>Chriſt is in every juſtified perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the further underſtanding hereof, I will let you know in a word or two (for I purpoſe but to touch it) how the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in all juſtified perſons. Firſt, he is in them, as the Houſholder or Maſter of the Family is in his houſe: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That he doth dwell in our hearts.</hi> Look as the Maſter of the Family dwelleth in his houſe, ruling, commanding, and ordering all things there, even ſo is Chriſt in them that are juſtified perſons. Again, he is in them, as the food that we receive is in our ſtomacks: Therefore he is often in the Scripture compared to meat and drink, becauſe as meat and drink are in us, after we have eaten and drunken; ſo is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alſo in all them that are juſtified, for their refreſhing, nouriſhing, and ſtrengthning, and preſervation of life in them. Laſt of all, He is in them as a mans life is in him; <hi>I live not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Chriſt is in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114897:29"/>ſoul of a poor ſinner that beleeveth, as our naturall life is in our bodies; as our life doth act and move us, being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all thoſe motions that are in us, even ſo is Chriſt alſo in all juſtified perſons.</p>
                  <p>But you will ask, In what reſpect is it that the Lord Chriſt is ſaid to be in juſtified perſons?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Amongſt others, Chriſt is ſaid to be in them in theſe two reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe his Spirit is in them. By his Spirit I do not mean his humane ſpirit, his ſoul, as he is a man, that is proper to himſelf, as every mans ſoul is; but by his Spirit, I mean, the Spirit of God, the Holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; which is the Spirit of Chriſt, both as he is the ſecond Perſon in Trinitie; ſo the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Father, and alſo as he is the Mediatour of his Church; ſo it is his Spirit becauſe he hath merited, and as it were purchaſed it, to imploy it, and to ſend it about for the effecting of the ſalvation of the Elect. Now the Lord Chriſt is in beleevers by vertue of his ſpirit, becauſe his ſpirit is in them. This the verſe before the Text, and the verſe after plainly prove, where the Apoſtle maketh mention of the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in the faithful: <hi>If the Spirit of God dwell in you,</hi> v. 9. And <hi>If the ſpirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you,</hi> Verſe 11. This is the firſt Reaſon why Chriſt is ſaid to be in juſtified perſons; his Spirit is in them.</p>
                  <p>Another is, Becauſe the vertue, efficacie, life, and operation of Chriſt is in them, as the tree, or the root may be ſaid to be in the branches; becauſe the life and ſap of the tree is put forth in the branches: So my brethren, is Chriſt ſaid to be in the ſoul of every beleever, becauſe the vertue and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt is working in them, as truly as it is in himſelf, onely differing in regard of degrees and perfection.</p>
                  <p>Now for the fuller illuſtration of the Point, give me leave in the laſt place to ſhew you the means whereby Chriſt is in all them that are juſtified: They are theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the grace of Faith: For this in-being of Chriſt in all juſtified perſons, is the conſequent of their union with him:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114897:30"/>Now by faith they are joyned to Chriſt, and Chriſt being joyned to them, and they to him, Chriſt is in them, as well as they in him. Therefore in that forenamed place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to dwell in our hearts by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another means is, The abiding of Chriſts word in us, <hi>John</hi> 15.7. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you:</hi> In the fourth Verſe, our Saviour had ſaid thus, <hi>Abide in me, and I in you,</hi> now repeating that again, he ſomewhat altereth it, and ſaith, <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you:</hi> I conceive the ground of the alteration is onely this, becauſe the abiding of Chriſts word in people is a means whereby Chriſt doth abide in them. By the <hi>words</hi> of Chriſt, I take it, is meant the Goſpel of Chriſt, with all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſtructions, and promiſes, that are contained in it: Now when this Word of Chriſt doth abide in people, which it doth when underſtood, remembred, practiſed, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by this means Chriſt is ſaid, and made to abide in them. The words of Chriſt are as ſo many plants which he doth ingraft into a poor ſoul, as we doe ingraft Cions into a ſtock; Therefore the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>ingrafted word which is able to ſave your ſouls, Jam</hi> 1.21. Now look as the ſtock cometh to have the nature and to bear the fruit of the Cion, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Cion implanted and ingrafted into it; even ſo by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting the word of Chriſt into us, we come to have the ſap and life of the Spirit of Chriſt, and conſequently Chriſt himſelf to abide in us.</p>
                  <p>For the further underſtanding of the Point, you muſt in the laſt place know. That however the Lord Chriſt is in all juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons, yet he is not wholly and compleatly in them; not ſo as to exclude ſin and Satan out of them, Chriſt is in them, and ſin and Satan are in them alſo; ſo that Chriſts dwelling in them is but imperfect, yet notwithſtanding it is perfecting, and in the end ſhall be conſummate, and then Chriſt ſhall onely be in them, and ſin and Satan altogether ſhut out.</p>
                  <p>This ſerveth, my brethren, to teach us all, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt and ſureſt way to become juſtified perſons, and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114897:30"/>of Chriſt and all his priviledges; to wit, to get Chriſt to be in us. In vain doſt thou hope for any Chriſtian priviledge, in vain doſt thou indeavour after any thing that is neceſſary to ſalvation, if by faith Chriſt is not brought to be in thee. People doe oft trouble themſelves many waies, but moſt are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or negligent of this way, whereas our hope of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of the forgiveneſſe of our ſins, our labours and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after heaven are all in vain, if we doe not labour by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving to get the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be in us. Many conceit that Chriſt will be for them, but he will be for none, but for them in whom he is. I mean not now to diſpute whether Chriſt be for us or in us firſt; but this is ſure, he will be for none, but ſuch as he is in alſo. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory;</hi> The Connexion is to be obſerved, <hi>Chriſt the hope of glory,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt in you</hi> implying, that as we muſt have no hope but Chriſt (and therefore Chriſt is called <hi>our hope</hi>) ſo we can never have Chriſt to be our hope, if we have not Chriſt to be in us. Learn this therefore, I ſay, above all things, to labour to be joyned to Chriſt by a lively faith, that ſo you may come to have him in you, and then he ſhall be for you, and never till then. Thus much for the firſt thing, The condition of all ſuch as are juſtified; <hi>They have Chriſt in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond, which is the main thing the Apoſtle aimeth at, the Evidences or Signs whereby it may be known who have Chriſt in them; Yee have them in the next words: <hi>The body is dead, becauſe of ſin, but the Spirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Give me leave firſt to open the words unto you. By <hi>Sin</hi> you know is meant the tranſgreſſion of Gods law, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſide the rule of Gods Commandment, either in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is enjoyned, or in doing what is prohibited, this is ſin.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> alſo muſt be meant the contrary to this. For howſoever <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> is ſometime in the Scripture taken ſtrictly, for the obſervation of thoſe duties that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern men, which the ſecond Table injoyneth; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114897:31"/>it is taken largely, for the obſervation of the whole Law of God, and all duties concerning God and us; and thus it is uſually taken, when as it is not joyned with ſomething elſe that doth reſtrain it. Here it is oppoſed to <hi>ſin,</hi> and therefore as by <hi>ſin</hi> is meant the going beſide the Commandment of God; ſo by <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> is meant the obſervation or doing of the Commandment of God. Thus you ſee what is meant by <hi>ſin,</hi> and what by <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is more difficult to know what is meant by <hi>the bodie,</hi> and what by the <hi>Spirit? The bodie is dead, becauſe of ſin; but the ſpirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſſe.</hi> I take it, here by <hi>the bodie</hi> is meant the bodie of corruption, the bodie of ſin, that ſame Original corruption that is in all of us by nature. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood of the natural body, becauſe of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>ſpirit;</hi> for by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> here cannot be underſtood our ſoul or our ſpirit, for it cannot be ſaid, that any mans ſpirit or ſoul is life to righteouſneſſe, it may be ſaid that it is enlivened to righteouſneſs, but it cannot be ſaid to be life to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: therefore ſeeeing by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> the ſoul of a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant, I thinke it is clear that by the <hi>the body,</hi> the bodie of man cannot be meant. But by <hi>the body</hi> I conceive (as I ſaid) is meant the body of ſin, for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>That the bodie of ſin might be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Originall corruption is called a <hi>bodie</hi> in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe that it commeth to us by propagation, from the parents of our bodies.</item>
                        <item>2. To expreſſe the baſeneſs of it, for our bodies are but baſe and vile, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.</item>
                        <item>3. To expreſſe the fadingneſs of it, for that is our comfort, as our naturall bodies are mortall, ſo the body of ſin, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall corruption, is alſo mortall to all the Saints. Therefore it is called <hi>fleſh,</hi> becauſe through the merit of Chriſt and the mercie of God it is tranſitorie to all beleevers.</item>
                        <item>4. Laſtly, it is called <hi>a bodie,</hi> becauſe as our bodies are made up of many Integrals, and conſiſt of ſeveral members, by which they act and exerciſe ſeverall functions; ſo alſo originall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114897:31"/>corruption is one thing conſiſting of many particular ſins, as ſo many integrall parts or ſeverall members, whereby it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth it ſelf in ſeverall operations. For theſe and ſuch like reaſons Originall corruption is called a <hi>bodie.</hi> Thus you ſee what is here meant by <hi>bodie.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now it is more eaſie to underſtand what is meant by <hi>the Spirit: The Spirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſſe:</hi> For if by the <hi>body</hi> be meant originall corruption, then by the <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt be meant originall righteouſneſſe, that which is elſewhere in the Scripture called the <hi>divine nature,</hi> or <hi>the ſeed of God,</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> or <hi>holineſs,</hi> or the like. Originall holineſs or righteouſneſs is that which (I take it) is here meant by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> It is ſo called <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit;</hi> and ſo in many other places.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſame habit of holineſs is called the Spirit:
<list>
                        <item>1. To ſhew the excellency of it, That as a Spirit is an excellent thing, far above all bodily ſubſtances; ſo is holineſs the excellenteſt of Gods creatures, for grace is alſo a creature as other things.</item>
                        <item>2. To ſhew the durableneſs of it; though ſin ſhall die in the Saints, and be utterly deſtroyed; yet grace ſhall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, ſtroyed, nor ceaſe in the Saints of God.</item>
                        <item>3. It is called the <hi>Spirit</hi> in regard of the Objects of it, for the Objects of this grace are ſpirituall things.</item>
                        <item>4. In regard of the Author of it. It is the holy Spirit of God, that begets and works it in people; therefore as the child beareth the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo doth this of the Spirit.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what is meant by <hi>ſin,</hi> namely, the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Law, either in omiſſion or commiſſion: What by <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> The obſervation of Gods Law in the duties of the firſt and ſecond Table: What by the <hi>bodie;</hi> Originall corruption; What by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the habit of holineſs, or originall righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now then the whole amounteth to this; That if ſo bee the Lord Chriſt be in people, then there is a death of ſin in them, and a life of righteouſneſſe: Thus much is meant by the words, let them be taken any way, which way ſoever Expoſitors can carry them, this muſt be the ſence of them;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114897:32"/>and therefore we need not ſpend further time in the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but will fall directly upon the Doctrine, which is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In whomſoever Chriſt is, there is a death of ſin, and a life of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Point is very evident and expreſſe in the Text (being the main matter, ſcope and drift thereof) as well as in other places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>For the proving of it, (not to trouble you with many other Scriptures) you may conſider theſe things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ends and the offices of Chriſt, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquitie, and purifie unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> The main end of Chriſt is the redemption of a people from all iniquitie; which implieth not onely the removal of the guilt of ſin, but the deſtroying of the bodie of ſin. Therefore 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. it is ſaid, <hi>That for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devill.</hi> Not onely the guilt of ſin, but the power and dominion of ſin is the work of the Devill; now therefore (<hi>for this purpoſe</hi> ſaith the Text) the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might free us from the guilt, yea and from the dominion, and life, and power of ſin. There is one end.</p>
                  <p>Another end of Chriſts giving himſelf was, <hi>To purifie us,</hi> therefore he muſt put ſin to death in us; for to purifie is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to purge out corruption, as the fire doth work the droſſe out that is in the gold.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>To purifie us that we might be a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> Where there is a zealouſneſſe of good works, there muſt be a life of righteouſneſſe. So that by that place you plainly ſee, that the end of Chriſt is the putting of ſin to death, and bringing in the life of righteouſneſſe: Moreover, Chriſt was to be the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> and he is ſo called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. And to ſpeak the truth, the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Who is the Figure</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:114897:32"/>(or <hi>Type</hi>) <hi>of him that was to come:</hi> For not onely the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies amongſt the Jewes were Types of Chriſt, but even <hi>Adam</hi> in his fall, in his undoing the world, in his overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mankind was a Type and Figure of Chriſt alſo. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly other Types did figure out Chriſt by way of ſimilitude, but <hi>Adam</hi> by way of diſſimilitude and contrarietie: For look what <hi>Adam</hi> did, the contrary to that Chriſt is to doe. Now <hi>Adam</hi> did cauſe to all in whom he was as the Parent is in the child, a death of righteouſneſſe, and a life of ſin: Therefore the contrary the Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt work in all thoſe in whom he is, a death of ſin, and a life of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this Point is alſo plain from the conſideration of thoſe reſpects in which Chriſt is ſaid to be in people. Thoſe are (as you heard before) Firſt in regard of his Spirit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in regard of his Vertue, influence, and ſap that is in them. Now where ever theſe are, there muſt be a death of ſin, and a life of righteouſneſſe. For the former, even as fire doth purge away droſſe and ruſt; ſo the holy Ghoſt works out corruption, and puts ſin to death where ever he cometh; and as light expelleth darkneſs, even ſo doth he expell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe and ſin, becauſe he is the holy Spirit. Again, for the vertue and life of Chriſt, you know it was the life of righteouſneſſe, therefore whereever this is, there muſt be a life of righteouſneſſe in that man.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, the truth of this will appear from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that communion with Chriſt, and conformitie to him, that all thoſe muſt have which are in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them: Wherein they muſt have a communion with, and a conformitie to Chriſt, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. from the third verſe to the twelfth. In the third Verſe he layeth down that Union by Faith which all juſtified perſons have with the Lord Jeſus: and from this he inferreth a communion with him, and a conformitie unto him. But in what? In his death, and in his reſurrection: <hi>If we have been planted together</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>in the likeneſſe of his death,</hi> (mark, not in the <hi>ſame</hi> death, but in the <hi>likeneſs</hi> thereof) <hi>wee ſhall bee alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection.</hi> Where the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114897:33"/>Apoſtle declareth, that like as there was in Chriſt a bodily death, and a bodily reſurrection; ſo there is in all thoſe, in whom Chriſt is, a death of the bodie of ſin, and a reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in regard of the life of righteouſneſſe. This the Apoſtle plainly and largely proveth in that place.</p>
                  <p>For the further opening of this Point, you muſt conſider, that there are divers degrees both of the death of ſin, and of the life of righteouſneſſe. Firſt, there is a perfect death of ſin, when the whole body of ſin is altogether deſtroyed, and perfectly rooted out of a man: And there is an imperfect death of ſin, when the whole body of ſin, and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of it, is in part, and but in part, deſtroyed, and rooted out of a man. Again, on the other ſide, there is a perfect life of righteouſneſſe, when the whole frame of holineſs is perfectly and compleatly ſet up in a man; and an imperfect life of righteouſneſſe, when the ſame frame is in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of it, yet but imperfectly ſet up. My brethren, that I chiefly deſire you ſhould mark is this; That in the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect death of ſin, and in the imperfect life of righteouſneſſe, there is a kind of perfection, in regard of the particular parts both of the body of ſin, and of the frame of holineſs. There is no part, no member of the body of ſin, that is not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſuppreſt, onely it is deſtroyed but in part, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Every member, I ſay, of the body of ſin doth in part ſuffer death. Therefore the Scripture calleth it the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body, <hi>Rom. 6. 6. Our old man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is crucified with Chriſt, that the body of ſin might be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> It cannot be ſaid that the old man is crucified, or the body of ſin deſtroyed, if ſo be that every part of the old man, and every member of the body of ſin bee not in ſome meaſure deſtroyed. But although every part and particular of the body of ſin be deſtroyed, yet here is no part, no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but is ſtill alive and unſubdued, even in the people of God. Even in them that be in Chriſt there are the ſeeds of all corruptions to be found, there are the reliques of every kind of ſin, there are the luſtings of every fruit of the fleſh; and ſometime one part of the body of ſin, ſometime another
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114897:33"/>part (according as God is pleaſed to leave them for their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) doth break out and manifeſt it ſelf in them.</p>
                  <p>So it is alſo in regard of the life of righteouſneſſe: That ſame imperfect life of righteouſneſſe hath in it every part of holineſſe, ſo that there is no grace that is not in part quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no piece of the Image of God, that is not in part ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the ſoul. Thereupon it is ſaid, That the godly have <hi>the ſeed of God remaining in them,</hi> that they are <hi>partakers of that divine nature,</hi> that they have the Law of God <hi>written in their hearts,</hi> that they <hi>bear the Image of God,</hi> that they be <hi>the children of God,</hi> None of theſe things could be ſaid of them, if they had not every part and particular of grace and holines in ſome meaſure in them; yet notwithſtanding there is no part, no particular of the body, and frame of holineſs perfectly in them, but onely imperfectly, and in degrees. Thus you ſee what is here meant by the death of ſin, and the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; not that which is perfect, for that ſhall never be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to till after the death of the bodie; but that which is imperfect, and that is infallibly in all in whomſoever Chriſt is. Yea, and not onely one of theſe, but joyntly both of them are imperfectly in all theſe that are in Chriſt; and therefore the Apoſtle in the Text joyneth them both together. For howſoever we will not now ſtand to diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the life of righteouſneſſe be the cauſe or ſpring of the death of ſin, as the coming in of light is the cauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of darkneſſe; yet this is ſure, that they are alwayes inſeparable, and go together; there is no life of righteouſneſs where there is not a death of ſin; and there is no death of ſin, where there is not a life of righteouſneſſe: Now then my brethren, the ſenſe and meaning of all this Point, that I have thus opened and proved to you cometh to thus much: That who-ever have Chriſt in them, they have the whole body of ſin in every part of it weakned and deſtroyed, and the whole frame of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe in every part of it begun in them, though both but in part.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave now as briefly as I can to make application.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, here you have a cleer locking-glaſſe, wherein you
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114897:34"/>may be able to judge of the faces, of the ſtate and temper of your ſouls. I beſeech you conſider it well, and the Lord ſet it home upon your hearts; either you have Chriſt in you, or you have him not in you: If Chriſt be in you, then you have this imperfect death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſſe; but if you have not this, then Chriſt is not in you. Be exhorted therefore I beſeech you to try your ſelves by this touchſtone.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, How ſhall I be able to know, whether I have this ſame death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſſe in mee yea or no? This is ſhewen already; yet to help you more particularly, I will ſhew you how you may judge of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſſe, which is to be found in us in this world. And firſt for the death of ſin, you muſt know that there is a great deal of difference, between the reſtraint or the ſleep of ſin, and this death of ſin. Many people deceive themſelves with taking the reſtraining or ſleep of ſin, for the death of ſin; And indeed many times a ſin that is reſtrained or aſleep, may appear to others, and to a mans ſelf, to be more dead then a ſin that is dead indeed. For this ſame death of ſin, that is to be in all thoſe that have Chriſt in them, is not (as I ſaid before) an utter deſtruction, a plenary and full aboliſhment of ſin; but it is onely a weakning, a leſſening, and diminiſhing thereof. Now a ſin that is onely weakned, and yet ſtirreth, may be more manifeſt then a ſin that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained or aſleep, and ſtirreth not for the preſent. One that is ſhut up in a priſon cannot do ſo much in the ſtreet, as a weak and dying man that is in the ſtreets: and one that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep cannot doe ſo much as a weak and dying man that is not aſleep: Even thus many times ſin, ſo long as the ſit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, or ſleep laſteth, doth not manifeſt it ſelf ſo much as when it is dead with this imperfect death, for then it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakned and leſſened in the ſtrength of it. Therefore I ſay, it concerneth us much to know the difference: And I conceive you may know it by the effects of the death of ſin; which are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, where the body of ſin is leſſened and weakned, there no ſin can command the whole ſoul: but howſoever it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114897:34"/>may command part of the man, yet there is no part that will be wholly commanded by it. This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſheweth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. from the 15. verſe to the end of the Chapter. It is true, (ſaith he) <hi>with my fleſh,</hi> that is, with my unregenerate part (for by <hi>fleſh</hi> there he doth not mean his bodie, but the naturall part both of ſoul and bodie) <hi>I ſerve the law of ſin, but with my minde</hi> (that is, with the regenerate part of ſoul and bodie) <hi>I ſerve the Law of God.</hi> Whereever there is a death of ſin, there will be a part in every part of a man, that will not be ſubjected or commanded by any ſin. This I take to be the meaning of that 1 <hi>joh. 3. 9. Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin; for his ſeed remaineth in him, and hee cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> That is, ſo far as he is born of God, that ſame part in him, which is the ſeed of God, the off-ſpring of God, it cannot ſin; ſin cannot command that, though it command all the reſt. Thereupon it is called the <hi>divine nature,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> becauſe as the Spirit and the divine nature will not be maſterd by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo the regenerated part of a man will not be commanded by any ſin whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, (which is indeed a fruit of the former, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſion of it) where there is this death of ſin, there ſin is never committed with full conſent, delight, and purpoſe of heart. They that have ſin alive in them, <hi>drink down ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie like water, and draw ſin unto them as it were with cart-ropes.</hi> And that I conceive the Pſalmiſt meaneth by <hi>departing wickedly from God, Pſal.</hi> 18. 21. They that have ſin dead in them imperfectly may depart from God, but they doe not <hi>wickedly</hi> depart from him, not with full conſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, delight, and purpoſe of heart. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>They that are after the fleſh, doe minde the things of the fleſh.</hi> A man that hath ſin dead in him, may commit ſin, but hee doth not minde ſin. We may conceive what this minding is by this ſimilitude: When a woman that is with child ſtrongly longs after ſomething, ſhe doth minde that thing: How? her mind is continually upon it, her ele, her heart, her fancis, her thoughts, her whole ſelf, as it were,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114897:35"/>is taken up with it: Thus is it with thoſe that have ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in them, their particular corruptions are minded by them, they doe with full gale poſt after the ſatisfying their luſts. They are ſaid to <hi>make proviſion for the ſleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof. Rom.</hi> 13. 14. But now they that have ſin dead in them, doe never commit ſin with the full bent of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with the full conſent and delight of their will; but there is ever an antipathy to the ſin, a with-drawing from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſomething that doth luſt againſt it, as well as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth luſt after it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he that hath ſin dead in him, is freed from many particular ſins that he did formerly commit: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>When we were in the fleſh,</hi> (that is, when ſin was alive in us) the <hi>mations of ſins which were by the law, did work in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to bring forth fruit unto death.</hi> While ſin is alive, it is perfectly fruitfull, but when it is dead, the fruitfulneſs thereof is much leſſened. <hi>Such</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>were ſome of you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. implying, that now they were not ſuch, though formerly they had been. There is in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate a ceaſing of many, though not of all the actions of ſin: The power of ſin in them is weakned, therefore the fruitfulneſs of ſin muſt needs be diminiſhed. There is a great alteration wrought in their wills and affections, in their thoughts, words and actions, in their generall and particular calling, in their duties towards God and man: They do not bring forth ſo many fruits of ſin as they were wont, at leaſt they doe now, for the ordinary courſe of their lives, refrain from bearing the fruit of ſuch ſins, as are groſſe or ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the godly in whom ſin is dead, doe not onely ceaſe bearing the fruits of groſſe and ſcandalous ſins, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, though not perpetually, are able to deny and forbear the committing of any particular ſin, even thoſe that are moſt naturall to them, moſt ſtrong in them, that are wont to catch them on a ſudden, and to prevail over them, even thoſe the godly have power oftentimes to reſiſt and overcome. A man that is in the fleſh, that hath ſin alive in him, is deſcribed,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114897:35"/>
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. to be ſuch a one as doth fulfill the <hi>deſires of the fleſh,</hi> and therein appeareth the life of ſin, when <hi>the deſires of the fleſh</hi> are alwaies fulfilled. But now on the other ſide, the imperfect death of ſin appeareth in this, that not onely ſome of the deſires of the fleſh are never fulfilled, but even all the deſires of the fleſh, are alwayes more or leſſe croſſed, and not fulfilled. And this I take to be the meaning of that, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that you cannot doe the things that you would.</hi> I ſuppoſe, that latter clauſe, <hi>You cannot doe the things that you would,</hi> is not onely meant of the Spirit, that by the fleſh the Spirit is diſabled to doe the things that it would; but it is alſo meant of the fleſh, that by reaſon of the Spirit, the fleſh cannot doe the things it would; that look as ſometimes the remnants of the fleſh doe hinder the Spirit, that it cannot doe as it would, ſo alſo the beginnings of the Spirit do hinder the fleſh, that in nothing it is able to do the things it would. This is a fourth Effect whereby the weakning of corruption doth appear; That ſin is not able to work in us that which it would, no not in any particular whatſoever; but in thoſe ſins that are moſt naturall many times, there is a denying of them, and a forbearing to commit them, and to fulfill the deſires of them.</p>
                  <p>Now to theſe you muſt in the laſt place, add that which is a propertie accompanying all of them, and is the laſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whereby the death of ſin appeareth; and that is, That this ſame weakning and leſſening of corruption, diſcovered in theſe Effects, that I have opened unto you, is both univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, and alſo durable, and permanent. Firſt it is univerſall; there is not onely a weakning and leſſening of corruption in ſome parts, but in all. And herein it differeth from all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit death of ſin, in which there may be a weakning of ſome ſins, yet not of all, but though ſome happily be weaker then they were, others are as ſtrong as ever: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this death of ſin is indeed, there ſin is univerſally weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and this alſo will appear in all the particulars and parts
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114897:36"/>of it. Again, it is conſtant, not onely for a time, but for ever; Yea and there is a progreſs in it alſo, ſin ſtill groweth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and the ſtrength thereof daily more and more abateth. But where is not ſuch progreſs, where there is not a continuance in the deaths-wound of ſinne, there the deaths-wound was never given to ſin by the bleſſed ſpirit of Chriſt: For howſoever Chriſt doth not kill the old man preſently, yet he killeth it cortainly, and when once the deaths-wound is given, it can never be recovered any more. Hereby you may trie whether there be a death of ſin in you; however you may finde in your ſelves all the parts and kinds of ſin and corruption, the ſeverall luſts and inclinations of the fleſh, riſing and bubling up in you, however ſome times particular corruptions may have a very ſtrong hand, and put forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of might in you, to the maſtering and captivating of you, ſo that you are for the preſent <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> as the A poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. yet if there be this leſſening and weakning of corruption, and that univerſally and conſtantly, it is moſt certain there is a death of ſin in you.</p>
                  <p>Now on the other ſide let me ſhew you, how you may know the life of righteouſneſs; and this will alſo help you the better to diſcover the death of ſin: For as yee have heard both goe together, and the one helps to manifeſt the other. Therefore I ſay, in the next place, let us conſider the ſeverall effects of the life of Righteouſneſſe, which are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, where ever there is a life of righteouſneſſe, there is a ſeeking after God, and after the things of God: Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is of a divine nature, and therefore it alwaies carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoul wherein it is, up to God, from whence it came. As the fire being heavenly, doth alwaies move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſo righteouſneſs becauſe it is of God, doth alwaies raiſe up the ſoul of that perſon in whom it is toward God. Hence it is that the righteous are deſcribed to be, <hi>a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them that ſeek the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 24. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 8. the Pſalmiſt profeſſeth that he will <hi>ſeek the face of god.</hi> People that have no life of righteouſneſs are deſcribed <hi>Rom.</hi> 7 to be ſuch as do not <hi>ſeek after God.</hi> But whereever there is a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114897:36"/>life of righteouſneſſe, there is a ſeeking after God, God in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, God for himſelf, God as he is accompliſhed with his holy excellencies, and admirable Attributes and perfections; God as he is, take him altogether, is alwaies the aim and ſcope, end, and object of the deſire of that ſoul that is endued with the life of righteouſneſſe; ſo that when he praies, or receives the Sacrament, or hears the word, or whatſoever he doth, he ſeeks after God in all. And as he ſeeks after God, ſo he ſeeks after the things of God, the favour and mercie of God, the preſence and fellowſhip of God, thoſe glorious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances which are Gods, and are called his, becauſe they are with him; the things of the kingdome of God, they are the things he ſeeks after, that hath the life of righteouſneſſe in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, where the life of righteouſneſſe is, there is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of the ſpirit, and an agreement of the heart to the whole law of God. I beteech you obſerve this, The body of righteouſneſs is nothing elſe but as it were the ſtamp of Gods Law, there is a proportion and conformitie between the one and the other; therefore in whomſoever the life of righteouſneſſe is in his ſpirit, there is a ſutableneſs of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole Law of God; ſo that howſoever there is much antipathie, and deformitie, and unlikeneſs, and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Law of God, yet notwithſtanding there is ſomething within that ſoul that is agreeable to the whole Law of God; ſo that there is no particular branch nor part of the Commandment of God, but it doth find a principle to which it is ſuted and agreeable, in the heart of all them that have the life of righteouſneſſe in them. And this I take it, is the meaning of that of writing the Law of God in their hearts; that is, the very Law of God in all the parts of it; it hath a ſtamp and impreſſion, and a reſemblance in the ſpirit of all them that have the life of righteouſneſſe. This the Apoſtle largely expreſſeth in that ſeventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the 15. Verſe and ſo forward, <hi>I conſent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Law, that it is good, and that it is holy and juſt.</hi> They that have the life of righteouſneſſe, they doe not onely finde a truth, and a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114897:37"/>juſtice in Gods Law, but they doe finde a goodneſs, a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in Gods Law; there is a ſutableneſs and an agreement between their ſpirit and the whole Law of God, not onely in ſome, but in all particulars. Thoſe branches of Gods Law, which are moſt contrary to their cuſtomes and naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and inclinations, they ſee them good, they behold them amiable, they finde a diſpoſition in their ſouls ſuteable and agreeable thereunto: And hence is that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi> There is the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>The third Effect of this life of righteouſneſs, it is a diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the evill of ſin. The want of the life of righteouſneſſe, is the very cauſe why people doe not ſee the evill of ſin: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people doe ſee the evill of the conſequences of ſin; the plagues and judgements that come for ſin, but they doe not ſee the evill of ſin. Take ſin in its own nature, as it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeneſs to the nature of God, as it is a tranſgreſſion, and a going beſide, a ſwerving from the Commandment of God, they doe not ſee any evill in ſin thus. But now where ever there is the life of righteouſneſſe, there is an apprehenſion and feeling of the evill of ſin, as it is ſin it ſelf; and the reaſon of it is cleer, becauſe that the life of righteouſneſſe is nothing but an impreſſion of the Law of God upon a man, therefore it muſt needs cauſe that ſoul in which it is, to know and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Evill of the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>In a word, they that have the life of righteouſneſſe in them, they doe in their hearts apprehend ſin to be the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and the moſt bitter thing that is in the world, whether it be a great ſin or a ſmall ſin, in regard of the matter of it: whether it be a ſecret ſin, or a publike ſin in regard of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: however ſin may differ, yet they apprehend the greateſt evill and bitterneſs to be in all ſin; thereupon it is, that they are as truly, though not as ſtrongly, ſhy of the leaſt ſin as of the greateſt; of the ſecreteſt ſin, as of the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and ſcandalous ſin. You have Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the bodie of this death?</hi> The remembrance of that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114897:37"/>Originall corruption that was in his ſoul, and could never be rooted out, this made him to cry out for deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Again Fourthly: Whereſoever there is the life of righteouſneſſe, there is a diſcovering and diſcerning of the ſeverall Particulars of ſin and of unrighteouſneſſe. Light it doth diſcover all things that are foul and are amiſſe; and life doth oftentimes diſcover weakneſſes, and illneſſe, and ſtraightneſs we know diſcovers crookedneſs; ſo where ever there is the life of righteouſneſs, there is a diſcerning of that inward contrarietie of unrighteouſneſs that is in that heart. I know that no man can diſcern all the evils that are in his ſoul, becauſe the life of righteouſneſs is not perfect, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in this world; but yet notwithſtanding he that hath the life or righteouſneſs, he doth in part diſcover every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in his ſoul; he doth ſee in himſelf the corruptions that are contrary to the whole frame of righteouſnes, he doth ſee in himſelf the iniquities that are the tranſgreſſions of the whole Law of God. Hence it is that the children of God are ſo humbled; for a child of God, one that hath the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in him, cannot be proud, for he having a life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs commeth to ſee the death of ſin in him, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern in himſelf an univerſall contrarietie in part to the whole Law of God. Hence it is alſo that they thinke worſe of themſelves then of any other, becauſe by the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, they diſcern the remnants of an univerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie that is in them to the whole Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The fifth Effect of the life of righteouſneſs it is this. Where ever there is the life of righteouſneſs, there are all the fruits of the Spirit in ſome part, and in ſome meaſure begun in them. The life of righteouſneſs it is not the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of one grace, but it is the quickning of the whole body of grace in us; the whole frame of holineſs, it is begun in them that have the life of righteouſneſs; there are all the fruits of the Spirit to be found in that ſoul. What they are you may read in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, there are all the fruits of the Spirit begun in that ſoul; ſo that there
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114897:38"/>is no grace that the word of God calleth for, that Chriſt hath, that the Saints of God ever ſhewed forth, but he that hath the life of righteouſneſs can diſcern it in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure begun, or beginning in himſelf. Take the loweſt and meaneſt Chriſtian of all others, if he have the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, he can finde in himſelf (if he doe not judge falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) at leaſt the buddings and bloſſomings of the fruits of the Spirit of God, of that which God requireth of his children. By the beginnings and buddings of grace, I mean, Firſt, a diſcerning of the wants of grace; for uſually the firſt work of grace is a diſcerning of the want of grace: The firſt work of the grace of humilitie, is a diſcerning of the want of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie; the firſt work of the grace of Faith, is a diſcerning of the want of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that there is, I ſay, a diſcerning of the want of ſuch and ſuch graces, but that is not all; hypocrites may ſometime ſee the want of grace, but there is together with a diſcerning of the want of grace, an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the excellencie of grace, a hungring and thirſting after the getting of it, a high valuing of thoſe that have it, and a conſtant uſe of the Ordinances for the obtaining of it.</p>
                  <p>And to all theſe Effects of the life of righteouſneſſe, (as to the former Effects of the death of ſin) you muſt add that Propertie, that it is laſting, it is a never-dying life: When this life of righteouſneſs is quickned and begun in any, it increaſeth and groweth up, it never dyeth, and is finally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have as briefly as I can, ſhewed you how you may trie your ſelves, whether you have this death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſſe, that is in all thoſe in whom the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is.</p>
                  <p>Now then (my brethren) be exhorted I beſeech you in the fear of God, to put in practiſe, and to make uſe of this Touchſtone, and looking-glaſſe. It is of uſe to all of us, not onely to you that are the people of God, but to you that are not; not onely to you that are not, but to you that are the people of God. Theſe touchſtones of the Scripture, theſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114897:38"/>ſcales and weights of the Sanctuarie, they are of uſe to all ſorts of people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To you that have the truth of grace in you, it is of great uſe to you to trie your ſelves by, for by often tryall you come to be ſetled and aſſured of the truth of your grace: And for want of this, you want the comfort of your intereſt in the Lord Chriſt, the comfort of your juſtification, and of your ſanctification, and conſequently of your ſalvation: You cannot but want comfort, ſo long as you want aſſured Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the truth of grace in you.</p>
                  <p>Again, you doe not onely want comfort, but you are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inabled to the ſervice of God, and growth in righteouſneſs by diſcouragements. Diſcouragements are to the people of God, as the cold winde, and froſts are to yong buds; and whence cometh diſcouragements? Becauſe people are not aſſured of the truth of their grace.</p>
                  <p>And not onely ſo, but laſtly, you are not ſo careful and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God as you ſhould, onely becauſe you are not rooted in the certaintie of the goodneſs of your eſtate. Therefore theſe tryals are of uſe to you.</p>
                  <p>And much more to you that are not yet in the ſtate of grace. What is the reaſon that ſo many drop into hell, and are tumbled down into the pit of deſtruction, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they live under the Goſpel, and the preaching of it? It is becauſe the Devill hath begotten in them vain hopes, groundleſs perſwaſions of their part in Chriſt, of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of their ſins, and ſalvation of their ſouls; and ſo while they have vain and groundleſſe hopes, hence it is that they goe to hell with a dream, and conceit that they go to heaven. Could we but once convince people that they are not yet in a right ſtate, and that all their vain hopes and imaginarie conceits are falſe, and will prove deceitful, there were a great deal of likelihood that they would obtain true grace, and ſo conſequently come to be everlaſtingly ſaved. Therefore I ſay, it is of uſe to all ſorts. I beſeech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make uſe of thoſe ſigns that the Scripture giveth you, whereby you may trie your ſelves. Doe not thinke that it is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114897:39"/>an irregular way to put people upon ſigns and tryals. I confeſſe there are ſome particular caſes, wherein it is not ſafe for ſome particular perſons, at that time, and in that caſe, to put them to try themſelves by ſigns. But for the generall it is neceſſary, and it is the dutie of all people to look to ſigns, and to try themſelves by them. And if there were nothing more, but this that is in the Text, me thinks it is an unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Argument, to confute them that crie out againſt Signs and Evidences of the truth of grace. Doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> as plain as any man in the world can, put them upon the tryall of themſelves by Signs, telling them, that if they have ſuch and ſuch things in them, they are in a good eſtate, and if they have not, that they are in a dangerous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condition? Therefore I ſay, put it not off, but make conſcience to practiſe this duty, to view your ſouls in this, and the like looking-glaſſes.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially conſidering that which our Saviour Chriſt hath laid down for a certain truth, That <hi>there are many cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but few choſen.</hi> There were four ſorts of grounds upon which the ſeed of Gods word was caſt, and but one of thoſe four proved good. There were ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and went toward <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet but two of them that went into <hi>Canaan.</hi> There were twelve Tribes which the Lord had cauſed to make them cleave to himſelf, as a girdle to a mans loins, and yet there were ten of thoſe Tribes at one clap that were all caſt off from being the people of God, and but two of twelve that did remain. You know how that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us in <hi>Rom</hi> 9.27. <hi>Though the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the ſea, a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The Lord will put up righteouſneſs in a ſhort ſum, I ſay, conſidering theſe things, that there are ſo many of thoſe, that doe profeſs and hope to be ſaved, ſhall miſcarry, how much doth it concern us all to try our ſelves? When as our Saviour Chriſt had told his twelve Diſcriples, that one of the twelve ſhould betray him, every one began to put himſelf upon the examination, and asked their maſter
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114897:39"/>whether it were he? Were they ſo carefull every one to try himſelf, when Chriſt told them that one of the twelve ſhould betray him, and ſhall not we be carefull to try our ſelves when as the Scripture telleth us, that ſcarce one of twelve ſhall be ſaved, and that eleven of twelve Profeſſors are like to periſh and miſcarry? Oh the heart of man is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceitfull; hypocriſie is very ſtrong, and exceeding cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, hardly is a man able to finde out the ſtate of his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit when he tryeth it with all his dilgence.</p>
                  <p>But above all (my brethren) let me preſſe you to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to try and examine your ſelves, conſidering the times we live in. Theſe are the times wherein the Lord putteth people upon the tryall: trying times, even times like the times of the Fullers, purging his cloth, and the Goldſmiths refining his mettall: And there are more trying times like to come. Have we not wofull experience of divers falling away, ſome falling ſcandalouſly, perhaps being the Saints of God, <hi>Davids,</hi> and <hi>Lots,</hi> and <hi>Noahs,</hi> and <hi>Peters;</hi> for ſo it is poſſible that ſome that are the children of God, may yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding fall into ſcandalous and offenſive ſins, through their want of watchfulneſs, and fear, and carefulneſs. But a great many doe fall, and fall ſcandalouſly, yea many give all cauſe of fear that there never was the ſoundneſs and truth of grace in them, <hi>they went out from us, becauſe they were not of us.</hi> Now I ſay, conſidering that there are thoſe that doe fall, ſuch as take upon them the profeſſion of religion, and are eminent in the waies of Chriſt, and in the Goſpel, and yet fall, and fall deſperately and damnably: Doth it not concern us all to fear, and upon fearing to try our ſelves? When the Apoſtle diſcourſed of the fall of the Jewes, how they were broken and caſt off: What uſe did he teach the Gentiles to make of this? <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> So ſay I; are theſe ſuch times that many fall away? then ſuch of us as doe ſtand, let us alſo take heed that we doe not fall. How ſhall we take heed of falling? Oh let us look to our ſelves that we are ſound; the ordinary cauſe of falling away is rottenneſs and unſoundneſs, when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114897:40"/>people in hypocriſie take up the profeſsion of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us not make that uſe of the falls of holy men, as the people of the world doe; if there be any that falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any ſcandalous ſin, and manifeſts himſelf to be naught at the heart, what uſe doth the world make of it? To flie upon God, and upon religion, and upon all profeſſors of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and upon the Miniſters and Preachers of the word: Oh ſay they, this is their Religion, they are all but hypocrites, this will be the end of them all. Theſe kind of Uſes doth the world make of the falls of upright men: whereas alas, there is nothing leſſe uſe to be made of them than this: If ſo be that people were not deſperately malicious againſt God, and all goodneſs, and that they were not ſhamefully ignorant, they would never make this Uſe of the falls and ſcandalls of theſe men.</p>
                  <p>For firſt of all, how can it blemiſh God, or Religion, or good men, becauſe ſome that ſeemed to be good and were not good, doe diſcover their rottenneſs, and unſoundneſs by their falls? What kind of blemiſh was it to the holy Apoſtles, and to the beleevers in the Primitive Church, that ſome that were amongſt them did goe out from them? What kind of ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh was it to the twelve Apoſtles, that one whom Chriſt kept familiar company with, and was converſant with the Apoſtles as brethren, did prove a hypocrite? Was <hi>Judas</hi> his deſperate fall, a ſign that the Religion and Preaching of Chriſt were naught, and the other Diſciples hypocrites? None dare ſay ſo; and if it were not, then why ſhould it now be a ſign? They that doe fall away, they doe therefore fall away, becauſe they are not religious, and not becauſe they are religious. They therefore fall away, becauſe they did not obſerve the rules of that religion they profeſt, and not becauſe they profeſt it.</p>
                  <p>And as it argueth thus an ignorance in people, ſo further, if ſo be that the world were acquainted with the Goſpel, and works of God, they would know that the Lord hath decreed from all eternitie, that in all ages of the Church, ſome that have been eminent in profeſſion ſhould fall away. There muſt be offences and ſcandalls given, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114897:40"/>himſelf layeth down the rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.7. <hi>It muſt needs be that offences come.</hi> The Lord hath foretold it, and hath ever made it good in all ages and times of the Church, that there ſhall be offences and ſcandalls; and that for good ends. Firſt, to the making of them that are true hearted, to be more fearfull, and watchfull, and more diligently to try their own eſtates, and to fear leſt they fall; and by this kind of painfull and carefull fear, the Lord doth keep them that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall. And another end is in regard of the wicked world, the world lieth in wickedneſs, and it is curſed and hated of God, and intended to damnation; and there are a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church which the Lord hateth and abhorreth, and hath appointed to wrath; and there are ſome that hate God, and Religion, and are glad of any occaſion whereby they may reproach God and Religion, and may harden their hearts from the power and practiſe of Religion: Now in regard of theſe deſperate wretches, the Lord hath appointed it, that in all ages ſome profeſſors ſhall fall ſcandalouſly; that they that have a minde to have their hearts hardned againſt God and Religion, ſhould have them hardned with a vengeance; that even as a man that is running in a way, and another having a minde to make him fall, caſteth ſome ſtone or block before him that may make him ſtumble and fall: Even ſo, when the Lord ſeeth men deſperately cavilling againſt Religion, ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to harden their own hearts, and the hearts of others, the Lord will make his own children ſometimes to fall, though that it is not ſo common, but ordinarily hypocrites to fall, and lie in their way as ſtones, that they may ſtumble and fall, and periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>There is a woe to them that take ſcandals, all profane ones that will ſtumble at Religion, and reproach profeſſors and profeſſion becauſe of ſcandalls, there is a woe to them, and what woe? Even this, that thoſe ſcandalls are as ſo many ſtones tumbled in the way to make them break their necks in the pit of everlaſting perdition. And, therefore thus you ſhall finde, that uſually where the miniſtry of the Goſpell hath been any long time, and people have not been wrought
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114897:41"/>upon by the preaching of the Goſpel, are not brought to a powerfull profeſſion of religion, you ſhall uſually finde it, that the Lord doth ſuffer ſome profeſſors or other in theſe places to fall ſcandalouſly; Is it not ſo in many places in this City? And therefore I beſeech (my brethren) think of it, as you are afraid to be hardened, and to have a blackneſſe upon you of Gods wrath, take heed of making this uſe of the fals and ſcandals of any to harden your hearts againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or to tip your tongues with reproaches againſt the Goſpel and profeſſors, and ſo to grow to a hatred of the truth and power of godlineſſe. But the uſe you are to make of it is this, <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leaſt he fall:</hi> Is one fallen? take heed thou doeſt not fall alſo; and to the end thou doeſt not fall, have a care to trie and examine thy ſelfe: Looke to thy ſelfe, that thou have a ſure ſtanding. Therefore I beſeech you make uſe of this Looking-glaſſe, take this text of Scripture, and by it try your ſelves; if you be right, Chriſt is in you, if Chriſt be in you, there is a death or ſinne, and a life of righteouſneſſe. Thus much for the firſt Uſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Uſe in a word, and that is for Comfort, and Terror. Is it ſo, that thoſe that have Chriſt in them have a death of ſinne and a life of righteouſneſſe; then here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſome of you, and terror to others of you. Comfort to all ſuch of you as finde in your ſelves this death of ſinne, and this life of righteouſneſſe. Doeſt thou find, that there is this death of ſinne in thee, this life of righteouſneſſe in thee? Oh then be comforted, for thou haſt Chriſt in thee, and thou art certainly in Chriſt; God is reconciled to thee, thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is juſtified, thy ſinnes are forgiven, and thy ſoule muſt be everlaſtingly ſaved, therefore be thou comforted. It may be there is not ſo great a death of ſinne in thee as there is in others, but there is a death of ſinne in thee: It may be there is not ſo full a life of righteouſneſſe in thee as there is in others, but there is a life of righteouſneſſe in thee: If there be a death of ſinne and a life of righteouſneſſe, Chriſt is in thee, though thou come ſhort of that death and life that is in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114897:41"/>others: I pray is not the ſoule of man as truly in an Infant in the wombe, as in that childe that is borne and grown to ſome ſtrength? Is not the ſoule of man as truly in a weak and ſickly man, as in a ſtrong and luſty man? Is not the life and ſap of a tree in a plant that is truly ingrafted, though but newly, and ſtandeth in a manner looſe, and ſcarſe buddeth or bloſſometh, is it not as truly in that graft, as in a graft that is grown ſtrong and hath borne much fruit? Even ſo is it in thee, and therefore be comforted. I deſire to joy and glad your hearts that are in Chriſt, and have Chriſt in you; and I could not tell what better ſubject to pitch upon to bring you to comfort, becauſe I know this is the maine ground of all your diſcomfort, a doubt whether Chriſt be in you or not, therefore I thought it fit to ſhew you your faces in this Looking-glaſſe. If then you finde in you a death of ſinne, and a life of righteouſneſſe, know that Chriſt is in you. When as the Scriptures, and Miniſters from the Scriptures, doe open to you cleare ſignes and certaine evidences of the goodneſſe and truth of your eſtates, if you put away comfort then, you put away comfort when God ſpeakes to you; you refuſe to be comforted when the Lord will comfort you; you give the lie to God and to his Word; therefore take heed what you doe, if by theſe ſignes, or any ſuch which are cleare and evident, grounded upon the word of God, you finde your eſtates to be good, know then, and aſſuredly beleeve them to be good. It is true, I confeſſe, the heart of man is ſo deceitfull, that a man cannot try his own heart, and therefore the heart of man is ſo deceitfull, that Miniſters cannot try other mens hearts; none but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is onely able to know the heart; none but the King is able to diſcerne the man that had not on the wedding garment; you may paſſe the judgement of all the Miniſters and Servants of the King, and be let in to the feaſt: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, though neither man himſelfe nor Miniſter, is able to try the heart, yet this I confidently beleeve, that a man himſelfe, and a Miniſter alſo may know and try the hearts of people, if ſo be they deale faithfully and plainly with him.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114897:42"/>Though no man can diſcover the ſecret windings of the heart, yet the word of God doth: this word of God doth not onely lay down infallible ſignes, whereby people may know whether they are in the truth of grace; but the word of God doth lay down ſignes, whereby we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have thoſe ſignes or no: therefore if people will in the humility of their ſoules, nakedly (ſo farre as they know their own hearts) openly, and plainly, and particularly judge them by the Scriptures, and obſerve their hearts in the courſe of Gods dealing with them, and their dealing with God, and accordingly apply the touchſtone of the Scriptures; I am confident, by the ſignes and evidences of grace that are in the Scriptures, people may come to diſcerne their own hearts, not by any vertue or skill of their own, but by the vertue and skill of God, whoſe power goeth along with his Word. It is true, a Hypocrite may deceive the quickeſt-eyed Miniſter in the world, if he will not openly lay his heart before him: and therefore good Miniſters oftentimes ſpeake peace to them to whom no peace belongeth; yet they ſpeak the truth according to thoſe evidences that are expreſſed to them. Were not the wiſe virgins deceived in the fooliſh? Was not <hi>David</hi> deceived in <hi>Achitophell?</hi> Were not the Diſciples deceived in <hi>Judas?</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, as I ſaid, if people will ſincerely deal with their fellow brethren, and with their Miniſter, and when God calleth upon them to try themſelves, if they will turne their inſide outward, if they will nakedly lay open the ſtate of their own hearts, ſo clearly as they can diſcerne, I doubt not, but the Miniſter of God from the word of God may ſpeak aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace, and give them certaine evidences of the truth of grace. Were not theſe things thus, it were not poſſible we ſhould ever come to aſſurance: it were in vain that the Lord hath given us ſo many ſignes and tokens, if by obſerving and trying, we might not come to diſcerne the eſtate of our hearts. Therefore for ſuch of you as in truth find from time to time, by theſe and the like evidences, the truth of grace in you, know you, that there is ground of comfort for your ſoules.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:114897:42"/>
                  <p>And as this is ground of comfort to you that have theſe things; ſo it is ground of terror to thoſe that want them. I know you are almoſt all frequenters of the Word, ſpeakers well of the practiſe of religion, happily you have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in you, happily you have ſome Miniſters that ſpeak peace to you, happily there is no diſturbance in your conſciences, happily there is ſome kind of joy and rejoycing in you in hearing the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But my brethren, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is that can be in you, if this be not in you, if there be not a death of ſin, and a life of righteouſneſſe, be it known unto you, that Chriſt is not in you, neither are you in the ſtate of grace: You may go on and pleaſe your ſelves with dreams of a happy eſtate, becauſe of ſuch and ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of grace; yet this I aſſure you, if the death of ſin be not in you, and the life of righteouſneſſe, Chriſt is not in you, nor never will be for you.</p>
                  <p>Again therefore be amazed, and tremble, and fear, and caſt away your vain hopes, all you that have not found the death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſſe. Be aſſured of what the Lord Chriſt ſpeaks in <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>The words that I ſpeak ſhall judge you at the laſt day.</hi> Be aſſured of this that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will judge your eſtates by theſe, and ſuch like tryals as theſe are at the laſt day; and if you cannot <hi>be found meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> by the Miniſters, and Miniſtry of the Word faithfully diſpenſed from the Scriptures, you ſhall never be found meet to bee partakers of it in the judgement of God at the laſt day; for ſo as the Word judgeth, God judgeth, and as the Miniſter judgeth while he keepeth to the Scriptures, the Lord Chriſt will judge at the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee here is Comfort for ſome, and Terror for others: Comfort for ſuch as have a death of ſin, and a life of righteouſneſs; though there bee much corruption, though there be much weakneſs of grace in you, yet here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for you, and terror for all others, whatever their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues, and common graces, or their reſtraining gifts, or outward profeſſion is.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:114897:43"/>
                  <p>Well then, what now remains, but that in the laſt place, we be all exhorted from the Lord, to labour to increaſe the death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſs in us. They are but imperfect in the beſt of us, let us labour to make them both more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to perfect the death of ſin, and the life of righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Why ſo? Becauſe that the death of ſin and life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, they are the Evidences of Chriſts being in us, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the goodneſs of our eſtates; therefore the more theſe are, the more are our Evidences of our part in Chriſt, and the greater will our comfort be, and we ſhall make more ſure our calling and election. This is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> meaneth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Give all diligence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to make your valling and election ſure.</hi> But how is that done? by making ſure thoſe things in your ſelves that are the tokens, and ſigns, and evidences of Gods Election. How ſhall this be done? ſaith the Text there, adde one grace to another, <hi>to your faith vertue, to your vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindnes; and to brotherly kindneſs, love:</hi> perfect your grace, increaſe the life of righteouſneſſe, perfect in you the death of ſin, increaſe the ruine of the old man; the more you increaſe theſe things, the more you increaſe your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of your part in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>What can you deſire that is able to adminiſter to you ſo much comfort, to provide ſo good a help for you againſt thoſe fears we have ſo long juſtly feared; what can prepare you for thoſe enſuing calamities that are approaching, as your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a part in Chriſt? But nothing can give you ſo much evidence of a part in Chriſt, as the death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſſe. Therefore I beſeech you, ſtudie above all things, what ever elſe you neglect, to increaſe and perfect in you the death of ſin, and life of righteouſneſs, that ſo the Evidences of Chriſt being in you may be certain. And ſo much for this time and Text.</p>

                  <p>It is as evident in other places of Scripture, I might give you divers inſtances thereof, but that I onely purpoſe to touch this Point, and no more, becauſe you ſee I gather it from the Coherence; yet I will name you one or two, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler clearing thereof. God commandeth his people to fear his name, as you have it often in the Scripture; and in <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. he promiſeth to give them a heart to fear him, <hi>I will give them</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>one heart that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and their children after them.</hi> The Lord commandeth his people to love him, to ſet their hearts upon him, <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart,</hi> as you have it in the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> And the Lord promiſeth, that he will make them ſet their hearts upon him, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.14 <hi>I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure her, and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to her;</hi> the word is, I will ſpeak to her heart, as it is in ſome of the Margents of your Bibles: It is a metaphor alluding to the manner of a man, that having a deſire to have the conjugall affection of ſuch a maid, doth ſo ſet himſelf to allure her, and draw her, as to bring her heart for to love him, ſo faith the Lord, as I have commanded my people to give me their heart, I will allure them, and ſpeak to their heart, ſo as I will make them ſet their hearts upon me.</p>
                  <p>I need not give you any further inſtances, you ſee the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114897:45"/>point is cleare, and directly iſſueth from the coherence of the Text with the foregoing words, and by theſe places and the like, you may ſee the truth of the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner of dealing with his Children, that he pmiſeth to make them able to doe whatſoever it is that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to doe.</p>
                  <p>And this (my brethren) is the difference between the Covenant of workes and of grace, between the Law and the Goſpel. In the Law, (which is the Covenant of workes) the Lord commandeth many things, but promiſeth to helpe them in nothing; In the Covenant of grace which is the Goſpel) the Lord commandeth nothing, but he promiſeth to make them able to doe it.</p>
                  <p>If you aske me the ground, or reaſon of Gods dealing thus with his Children. I anſwer, there is a double reaſon of it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, Becauſe it is Gods purpoſe, that his children ſhall obey (in ſome meaſure) all his Commandements. It is the purpoſe of God, he hath decreed it from all eternity, that his people ſhall obey his Law; not perfectly, for that they have done onely in Chriſt their Head, their Husband, their Undertaker; not legally, for that is impoſſible, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their infirmities, but evangelically, in uprightneſſe, though not in perfection; In truth, though not in meaſure and degree. This the Lord hath decreed from all eternity, that his people ſhall keep his Commandements, as you ſee it promiſed in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.17. <hi>They ſhall walk in my ſtatutes, and keepe my judgements, and doe them.</hi> Now Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they are nothing elſe but the expreſſion of his eternall purpoſe to his children: ſo that whatſoever God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his children, that he hath from all eternity purpoſed to his children: God therefore having purpoſed this, that his children ſhall keep his Commandements in an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall manner, he muſt make them able to doe it, for except God helpe them to performe what he requireth, it is not in their power to doe it. In regard of obedience to Gods Commandements, Gods children are as the world was before
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114897:46"/>it was made, when it was nothing; there was no power in the world to have a Sunne, or Moone, to have a Sea, or Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, to have men, or beaſts, becauſe the world was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. So there is no power in Gods children to obey any Commandement, for in regard of obedience to God, they are as nothing, <hi>they are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes:</hi> therefore they are ſaid to be <hi>created of God unto good workes,</hi> implying, that before they were nothing. If therefore God will have it done, God muſt give them a power to doe it. Indeed it is true, they ought to doe it though they cannot, for they had a power once in <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore God may juſtly require it of them, yet they cannot doe it, for they are nothing. Here is then the firſt Reaſon, why God hath promiſed to enable him to doe all that he hath commanded, becauſe he hath purpoſed and reſolved that they ſhall obey him, and without his ability, they cannot obey him, for they are dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe God hath (for divers wiſe ends) decreed, that all the obedience of his children ſhall come from Chriſt, and by Faith. This is expreſſe in the Scripture, to the end that no man might glory in himſelfe, but that all glorying might be in Chriſt: God hath decreed this, that no obedience ſhall be wrought by any that is acceptable, but what ſhall come from Chriſt by Faith. Now if it come from Chriſt by Faith, then it muſt come by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for there is nothing the object of faith but a promiſe, and a divine promiſe: To the end therefore they may have a promiſe, God hath promiſed to enable them to all he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, that ſo they by faith reſting upon this promiſe, they might come to this obedience by faith, and ſo may have nothing to glory in themſelves. Here are the two Reaſons of the point: And ſo you ſee the obſervation cleare, that God commandeth his people nothing, but he promiſeth to make them able to performe it.</p>
                  <p>There is onely this caution to be added, that howſoever God promiſeth to enable his people to doe all he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, yet this ſhutteth not out their endeavour. His promiſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114897:46"/>of enabling them is upon this ſuppoſition, that they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in the uſe of the meanes he ſhall appoint them. The Lord in promiſing doth not meane that they ſhould be idle, and look that he ſhould doe all; but his promiſing includeth their endeavouring, and upon their endeavouring in the uſe of the meanes that God hath appointed, he hath promiſed to enable them to doe what he hath commanded. And this is very expreſſe in that ſame of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>verſe</hi> 27. and <hi>verſe</hi> 37. laid together. In <hi>verſe</hi> 27. there is a promiſe to make them able to keep the Law of God; <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and you ſhall keep my judgements, and doe them.</hi> But in <hi>verſe</hi> 37. he commeth in with this caution (which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to obſerve) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet for this be inquired of by the houſe of of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to doe it for them.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, it is true indeed, I have promiſed to enable you to all things I have commanded you, but yet know, though I have promiſed to doe all, yet I will not doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your indeavour, you muſt uſe the meanes (whereof prayer is one) and upon your uſing the meanes, I promiſe then to helpe you. If people he ſtill and will not up and be doing, God will not be with them: it was the ſpeech of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and be doing, and the Lord ſhall be with thee.</hi> Implying thus much, that though God hath promiſed, yet God will not be with us to enable us to any performance, except we alſo be up and be doing. This therefore is no incouragement to lazie Chriſtians, that reſt themſelves upon this, that when God would have them doe it, he will enable them to doe it, and ſo doe not to their uttermoſt endeavour themſelves: theſe are ſuch to whom God will performe none of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>Well now, this caution being added, let us come briefly to the Uſe of the Point. And the firſt Uſe it is to ſhew us the truth of that which the Apoſtle telleth us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements, and his Commandements are not grievous.</hi> Here is a Paradox, what, the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114897:47"/>Commandements of God not grievous; this the world cannot beleeve; The reaſon of the Apoſtles ſaying, they are not grievous, is becauſe of our love to God; for whom we love, none of his Commandements can be grievous to us. But this Doctrine ſheweth you the truth of it, upon another ground. Are any of Gods Commandements grievous, when God commandeth us nothing, but what he promiſeth to make us able to doe, ſo farre as ſhall be needfull for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, ſo we will indeavour our ſelves? Indeed I grant, that Gods Commandements are above the power of nature to obey: nothing harder to corrupt infirme nature than Gods Commands, but yet ſeeing that God hath promiſed to enable us to yeeld obedience to every Commandement, ſo we will doe our indeavours, what grievouſneſſe, or what unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſſe is there in the Commandement? You may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it by this ſimilitude: A King commeth to one of his Subjects, that it may be is not worth a thouſand pound, and giveth him a commandement to pay ten thouſand pound, but withall giveth him liberty to goe to his Exchecquer, and take it. If you look upon the greatneſſe of the ſum, and poverty of the man, it is a grievous command; but if you conſider this qualification, that the King hath promiſed to give him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pay it, there is no grievouſneſſe in it. Thus is it in all the commands of God to his children, God commandeth us things above the power of fleſh and blood, biddeth us doe what is above the abilitie of nature, but withall, promiſeth in the uſe of meanes, to make us able to doe them, therefore there is no grievouſneſſe in the Commands. God in this caſe dealeth with his children, as <hi>Joab</hi> dealt with <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.26, 27, 28. <hi>Joab</hi> he beſeiged <hi>Rabbah,</hi> and when he had in a manner taken it, he ſendeth a Meſſenger to <hi>David,</hi> to bid him come and take it, that he might have the glory. <hi>Joab</hi> had runne thorough the difficulties, he had in a manner done the work, but to the end that the glory might be <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi> when <hi>Joab</hi> had done the greateſt, he biddeth <hi>David</hi> come and doe it. Even thus it is, between God and his people: it is the Lord that works all our workes for us; it is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114897:47"/>the Lord that enableth us to obedience to all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he makes it very eaſie, and yet notwithſtanding, to the end we may have the glory of our obedience, and the reward thereof at the laſt day, when the Lord hath prepared it for us, he biddeth us come and doe it, he putteth the honour upon us, but the power that doth it is his own; there is no grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in any of Gods commands.</p>
                  <p>Oh (my brethren) beleeve this, that you may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to put your necks into the yoke of Chriſt. <hi>Come unto me</hi> (ſaith he in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.) <hi>and take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is eaſie, and my burthen light.</hi> Is not this true, that Gods yoke is eaſie, and his burthen light, when he biddeth us doe no more then he giveth us ſtrength to doe. Stand not out againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; doe not refuſe to ſubject your ſelves to his Commandements, becauſe the World, the Fleſh, and the Devill telleth you they are a burthen too great for you to beare: I tell you, they are eaſie, there is no more commanded, then ſtrength ſhall be given to obey. Here is the firſt Uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Second Uſe of the Point is to ſhew us, how exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unexcuſable all the defects and diſobedience of Gods people are. For why? There is nothing commanded them, but God hath promiſed to make them able to doe it: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they doe not doe it, is not the fault wholly their own? God hath commanded his children great things, but yet he hath promiſed to help them to doe it all; if therefore Gods children doe not doe it, is not the fault theirs? and what can they ſay for themſelves? Thou art commanded to mortifie thy luſts, thou art commanded to deny thy ſelf, thou art commanded to keep thy ſelf unſpotted of the world, thou art commanded to have thy converſation in heaven, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch commands; thou doeſt none of theſe, what canſt thou plead for thy ſelf? What excuſe haſt thou to make to excuſe thee from the guilt of theſe ſins? All that thou cauſt ſay is this, I am fleſh, and theſe Commandements are ſpirituall; I am full of ſin, and how can I obey the Commandements of God? they are too great things for ſo ſinfull a creature as I am to doe.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:114897:48"/>
                  <p>True, but yet notwithſtanding are they to great for God to doe: Is not God able to make thee able to doe them? Hath not God promiſed to make thee able to doe them? Yes, where is the fault then? what is the reaſon thou doeſt not doe them, but that thou walkeſt in ſo many tranſgreſſions? where is the fault? what canſt thou ſay for thy ſelf? Is not God able, or is not God faithfull? Yes, God can doe it, and God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doe it. Surely then the fault lieth onely in thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Conſider it ſeriouſly, and you ſhall finde one of theſe two things to be the cauſe of all the ſins you live in, that are the people of God: Either this, that you are not willing to bee made whole, you are not willing to be rid of your ſins; or elſe this, that you are not able to beleeve the truth of what God hath ſaid. One of theſe two is the cauſe of all the ſins of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thou art not willing it may be to be made whole, thou art not willing to obey Gods Commandements. Truth, God hath commanded thee a great many things, but thou art not willing to doe them, and becauſe thou art not willing, therefore God doth not make thee able. For (my brethren) this is a ſure rule, God never makes any able to obey, but they that firſt of all by God are made willing to obey. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. When our Saviour could cure that impotent man that lay at the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> he firſt asked him this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> If ſo bee he had not been willing, Chriſt would not have healed him. Why did Chriſt ask him the Queſtion? To ſtir up in him a deſire of being made whole, for God never giveth till we deſire.</p>
                  <p>Therefore look well, and it may be thou ſhalt find thou art not willing to obey Gods commands, thou art not willing to ſubdue every luſt; a luſt, that is ſuteable to thy conſtitution; a luſt, that is very ſweet to thee through long cuſtome, a luſt, that is dear unto thee by reaſon of the pleaſure or profit that it brings in, it may be thou art not willing to obey God in ſubduing this luſt: But even as it was with <hi>Jacob</hi> when he commeth to let <hi>Benjamin</hi> goe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſtriveth againſt himſelf, he would let him go,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114897:49"/>and he would not; neceſſitie conſtrained him that he ſhould go, but yet his affection made him unwilling he ſhould go. This kinde of ſtrugling there is in Gods people, when they look upon the command they know they muſt obey, but yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the dearneſs and ſweetneſs of their ſin, they are loth to obey: And this is the reaſon God doth not help thee in matter of obedience to his commands, becauſe thy heart is falſe, and thou art not willing to it. Oh what a ſhame is this, when God requireth no more but thy will, not to let him have thy will! for thee ſtill to be unwilling to obey, when Chriſt died for this end, that thou ſhouldſt obey!</p>
                  <p>But if ſo be thou canſt cleer thy ſelf in this Point, and canſt ſay thou ant willing to be made whole, look into thy ſelf once more, and happily thou ſhalt find that thou art not able to beleeve that God will make thee whole. When the father of the poſſeſſed child (in <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.) brought his ſon to Chriſt to be cured, <hi>Lord,</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 22.) <hi>If thou canſt doe any thing, have compaſſion on us, and help us:</hi> If thou canſt doe it? (ſaith Chriſt). <hi>If thou canſt beleeve, all things are poſſible to him that beleeveth.</hi> So I ſay to ſuch of you as are willing to obey Gods commands in all things, are you able to beleeve this Doctrine that I have this day preached, That God will make you able upon your endeavours to doe all he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth? if you could be beleeve this all obedience were poſſible: But here is thy fault, (if it be not in the former) thou canſt not beleeve God will give thee ſtrength over every luſt, a luſt that is ſtrong in thee by conſtitution, is ſtrong in thee by cuſtome, by education, a luſt that hath ſo great a rooting in thee, that hath ſo often foiled thee; that God will help thee againſt ſuch a luſt. Becauſe thou canſt not beleeve, here is the cauſe thou canſt not obey Gods commands. What a ſhame is this for thee not to beleeve the God of truth; not to bee able to take his word, when his word is confirmed by his promiſe, when his promiſe is ſeconded with his Oath, when his Oath is alſo accompanied with ſo many ſeals, as thou haſt had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed every time thou haſt received the Sacrament of the Supper; and yet notwithſtanding thou art not able to believe, what a ſhame is this!</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114897:49"/>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how that the ſins of Gods people are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unexcuſable; unpardonable they are not, mercie there ſhall bee, but yet notwithſtanding they are unexcuſable. All your diſobediences whatſoever they are, notwithſtanding all the frailty of your nature, they are without all excuſe: For the ground of your diſobedience is either becauſe you are not willing to obey, or elſe becauſe you are not able to beleeve the truth of what God hath ſaid. Therefore learn (I beſeech you) to be aſhamed of your ſelves, and of thoſe guilts and diſobediences that lie upon you; there is great ſault in your ſelves; for though you have no power in your ſelves, God having promiſed to make you able, you ſhould have been able, if you were not guiltie, either in want of a will to be cured, or in want of abilitie to beleeve what God hath ſaid. Here is the Second Uſe.</p>
                  <p>Again the third uſe of this point is to teach us what is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ready way to be able to obey Gods Commandements. This is a thing which all that are truly godly deſire much to know, and this point teacheth us, The onely way to be able to obey Gods Commandements is to beleeve; It ariſeth thus, God hath promiſed to make his people able to doe all that he commandeth: if God hath promiſed it, then they have no power but from God: it were but a ſlight thing for God to promiſe that, which they could doe of themſelves: God having therefore promiſed it, it plainly appeareth they have no power of themſelves to doe it: and God having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doe it, they muſt have this power to doe it, by laying hold upon the promiſe, and that is by beleeving. So that the onely way to attaine to any obedience, is by faith to lay hold upon the promiſe of God; In a word, all ſtrength to obey commeth by promiſe, the promiſe is made ours by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, there is no way therefore to obey but by beleeving. Hence it is, that in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. Faith is called, <hi>our victory, whereby we overcome the world;</hi> by the world is meant all ſinne, faith is our victory, that is, the inſtrument of our victory, as a ſword is called the ſouldiers victorie, becauſe it is the means whereby he gets the victorie: Faith is the means
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114897:49"/>whereby we come to have victorie over the world. Hence is that alſo in <hi>john</hi> 6. 29. They had asked our Saviour Chriſt this Queſtion: <hi>What ſhall we doe to work the works of God?</hi> How ſhall we bee able to doe it? ſaith Chriſt, <hi>This is the work of God, that you beleeve on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> There is no way to come to work Gods work, to obey Gods commands, but to beleeve in the promiſe of God, whereby he hath ingaged himſelf, to make thee able to doe whatſoever he commandeth.</p>
                  <p>Oh then, you that would fain better your obedience in theſe times wherein Gods judgements be abroad, when God ſo much expects we ſhould grow better; for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, there is never a child of God, but is much deſirous to be more obedient now than ever, now in theſe evill times; and I ſhould much ſuſpect that ſoul yet to bee under the power of Sathan and ſin, that by the judgements of God that are abroad, is not provoked to a reſolution, and endeavour to better obedience. Now I ſay to ſuch of you as deſire to grow better in obedience, learn the way. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what the Text ſaith, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Be not ſorry, for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> Would you have ſtrength to obey Gods Commandements better then ever? Here is the way, doe not give way to ſadneſs, and dumpiſhneſs, and diſcouragements. Godly ſorrow is to be admitted, and is a great help of bettering your obedience, but ſuch a ſorrow as doth afflict your ſouls, and keep them under diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this is not to be admitted; ſtrength of obedience ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in this ſlaviſh fear, but it is the joy of the Lord, that is your ſtrength: Get the joy of the Lord by beleeving that God will make you able to obey whatſoever he biddeth, and that will make you able to obey.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore is the way, ſearch out the promiſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath ingaged himſelf to help you in any duty you would perform: When you have found out that promiſe, labour to reſt upon that promiſe, labour to believe that as God hath promiſed to make thee able to doe it, ſo he will make thee able to doe it in the uſe of means. And I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114897:50"/>thee, <hi>According to thy faith it ſhall be unto thee:</hi> Here then is the third Uſe. God hath graciouſly undertaken to enable his children to doe all he biddeth them to doe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the onely way to doe what is commanded, is to get faith to reſt upon the promiſes, wherein the Lord hath engaged himſelf to help us to doe what he hath commanded. Firſt of all, finde out what is the will of God that thou ſhouldſt doe. Secondly, work thy heart to a willingneſs, and deſire to doe it. Thirdly, Bring thy ſelf to truſt upon God in the uſe of his means for abilitie to doe it; and then in the next place thou ſhalt be able to doe it in ſuch a meaſure as God will accept.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt Uſe of this Doctrine is, for a ſingular incouragement and conſolation to all that are Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Thou that art one of Chriſts, here is thy comfort: Whatſoever God in his word biddeth thee to doe, hee by his promiſe hath undertaken to make thee able to perform. Truth it is, the things that God hath commanded thee to doe, they are wonderfull hard, even impoſſible to fleſh and blood; but yet notwithſtanding to thee eaſie and poſſible, becauſe God hath undertaken to give thee ſtrength to doe them. So that thou haſt great cauſe to be incouraged, conſidering the power of God: the power of God is with thee, it is bound to be thine by his promiſe, and if God be able, thou ſhalt obey whatſoever he hath commanded thee, ſo thou wilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this promiſe, and uſe the means. Indeed I grant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods children are not enabled to do what God hath commanded; but the reaſon is, (as I ſhewed before) either becauſe they are not willing, and that is horrible baſeneſs; or elſe they are not able to beleeve this Doctrine, and that is horrible inſidelitie. But if thou couldſt but beleeve all that God hath ſaid, thou ſhouldſt be enabled to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God requireth of thee to doe, in an Evangelicall manner.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Lord Chriſt incourageth and comforteth his Diſciples, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 24. <hi>I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it is eaſier for a Cammell to go through the eye of a needle,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114897:50"/>then for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Here was a Doctrine that ſtumbled the very Diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for when they heard it, the Text ſaith, <hi>They were exceedingly amazed, ſaying, who then can be ſaved?</hi> Surely it is impoſſible for any to be ſaved if this be true, that the man, whoſe heart cleaves to any of theſe temporall things, cannot be ſaved, (for that is the meaning of the words, though Chriſt inſtanceth in a rich man onely, yet it is true of a voluptuous man, and of all thoſe that have their hearts cleave to any thing in the world) if this be true, it is impoſſible for any man to be ſaved, for it is impoſſible for any man but to have his heart cleave to ſomething in this world, either friends, or honours, or riches, or pleaſures. How doth Chriſt comfort them againſt this impoſſibility? In <hi>verſe</hi> 26. ſaith he, <hi>With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, It is true I grant, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any man to be ſaved, if you look to the power of man, becauſe it is unpoſſible for a man not to idolize ſome outward thing; but yet notwithſtanding with God it is poſſible. God can make a man live in the world, and yet have his affections divorced from all things in the world; and God will make you doe this, becauſe he hath promiſed to you, being his children, that whatſoever he biddeth you doe, you ſhall be enabled to doe in ſuch a meaſure as he will accept. Therefore as Chriſt comforted his Diſciples, ſo let us comfort our own ſoules; what God hath commanded, he will make us able to doe, therefore let us up and be doing, and beleeve the promiſes, and we ſhall prevail to an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall obedience. Thus much for this firſt Doctrine, that the Lord doth deale thus graciouſly with his children, that whatſoever he biddeth them to doe, he will enable them to doe it; he commanderh them, <hi>that ſinne ſhould not reign in their mortall body,</hi> and here he promiſeth, <hi>that ſinne ſhall not have dominion over them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having obſerved this from the coherence of the words, let us now come to the words themſelves, <hi>ſinne ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:114897:51"/>
                  <p>You have here firſt a promiſe. Secondly, the ground and reaſon of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all a promiſe in the former part of the words, <hi>ſinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ground of the promiſe, in the latter part of the words, <hi>for you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me briefly open the words unto you; and I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the firſt, <hi>ſinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> For the underſtanding of this, you muſt know, there is a double dominion of ſinne, the one is, when ſinne reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to obedience; the other is, when ſinne reigneth to death.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſay, there is a reign or dominion of ſinne to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: that is it which is ſpoken of in the 12. verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Let not ſinne reign in you, that you ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof:</hi> This dominion of ſinne, is when as ſinne doth ſit in the ſoule, as a King ſitteth upon his Throne, and commandeth the heart of a man, and all the members of his body, as a lawfull Soveraigne doth command his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>The other reign of ſinne, which is a reign unto death, is that which is ſpoken of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21. there the text ſaith, <hi>Sinne hath reigned unto death;</hi> and that is nothing, but the power that ſinne hath to damn all thoſe whom it hath lorded it over. Now both theſe are meant in the Text, for both of them goe together, the reign of ſinne to obedience, and the reign of ſinne to death and damnation: even as the light and heat of the Sun goe together, ſo doth the dominion of ſin to obedience and damnation goe together. Where-ever ſinne reigneth to obedience, that is, where-ever ſin is in the ſoul of a man as a King, making a man to obey it in his commands, as a Subject doth his Prince: there alſo will that ſin reign to the damnation of that man. Both of them are meant in the words.</p>
                  <p>So then the meaning of the words comes to this effect, that ſinne ſhall neither have dominion over you to obedience, nor
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114897:51"/>to damnation: ſinne ſhall neither reign over you, to make you obey it as a Subject his Soveraigne, nor to damn you for obedience of it. This is the meaning of the promiſe, and this is a promiſe that is made to all beleevers, to all that are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt. And the obſervation that I note from thence is thus much, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sinne ſhall never reign in the children of God, ſo as to make them obey it as a Subject their King; nor ſo as to damn them for obeying of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Point you ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is no more than the words of the Text explained: ſinne may dwell with a child of God; and ſinne may dwell in a child of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>It is no more I, but ſinne that dwelleth in me:</hi> But ſinne ſhall never reign over a child of God, neither to make him obey it with full conſent of will, as a Servant doth his Maſters commands, or as a Subject doth his Soveraignes laws, nor yet to damne him for obeying of it: thus ſinne ſhall never reign over any child of God, though it may be in him, and dwell with him, yet it ſhall never reign over him.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this you may ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Being then made free from ſinne, you became the ſervants of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> He is not made free from the preſence of ſinne, nor from the power of ſinne, for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proſeſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>I find a law in my members,</hi> that is ſinne, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the law of my mind,</hi> that is the grace of God that is in me, <hi>and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſinne.</hi> Therefore ſinne may be in a man: A child of God is not free from the guilt of ſinne neither. But how then is he free from ſinne? Thus, he is free from the dominion of ſinne; ſinne doth not reign in them as a Lord and King; ſinne doth not reign in them ſo as to damn them for it.</p>
                  <p>This is that alſo in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74. 75. <hi>That he would grant us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without feare, in holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, all the daies of our life.</hi> Obſerve this Text; Every one that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114897:52"/>is a child of God is delivered out of the hands of his enemies, that is, out of the hands of his ſpirituall enemies, the world, and the fleſh, and the Devill; and he is delivered out of the hands of theſe enemies, that he might ſerve God without fear in holineſs and righteouſneſſe: But how can any man be thus delivered from hell, and ſin, and the Devill, to ſerve God without fear in holineſs, and righteouſneſs, if he be not delivered from the reign and dominion of ſin, both as a King, and as a Judge to damn him.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee the Doctrine is cleared, That all that are Gods people are delivered from the reign of ſin, ſin neither reigneth in them to Lord it over them, nor to damn them.</p>
                  <p>I will briefly give you the grounds of the point, and ſo come to apply it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reaſon why all Gods children are delivered from the domnion of ſin is, becauſe that all the reign of ſin, both as a Lord and as a Judge, both to damnation and to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it all cometh through the juſtice of God, which hath leſt us thereto, to puniſh all ſins in <hi>Adam:</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt he ſatisfieth the juſtice of God, he appeaſeth the wrath of God, in all particulars wherein we have provoked him: Gods juſtice being ſatisfied, he takes off the puniſhment, and ſo delivereth his people for whom Chriſt hath ſatisfied from the dominion of ſin, both to obedience, and to damnation. This then is the firſt Reaſon, Becauſe Chriſt he hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God, and hath delivered all his people from that curſe, and that miſery that lay upon them by the Law. This is that you have in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>God ſent his Son made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> We are under the Law in a twofold reſpect: Firſt, we were under the accidentall power of the Law, whereby the Law through our corruption did multiply tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions in our ſouls, and beget ſin upon us, as a man beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth children. Secondly, We were <hi>under the Law</hi> in reſpect of the curſe of the Law, the Law curſing all that broke it, and curſing of them to damnation: we were under the curſe of the Law in this reſpect. Now Chriſt hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114897:52"/>all his children from <hi>under the Law</hi> in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Firſt, in the firſt reſpect, he hath redeemed all his children from under that accidentall power of the Law, where by the Law had power through our corruption to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply tranſgreſſion upon occaſion of every Commandement it gave; for the Law of God commanding and forbidding, and our corruption being ſtrong in us, we broke every Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo the Law occaſioned a multiplication of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Now the Lord Chriſt hath delivered us from under this accidentall power of the Law in ſome meaſure; ſo that how ſoever ſtill through the remainder of corruption, the Law occaſioneth a great many ſins in us, becauſe it commandeth, and we doe not obey; yet the Law doeth not occaſion any reigning ſin, becauſe there is nothing the Law commandeth but we obey it in ſome meaſure, I pray obſerve it. They love the Law of God, they ſtrive to obey it, they grieve when they cannot obey it, now this according to the Goſpel is counted obedience. Thus Chriſt hath delivered us from the Law, as it did occaſion ſin to reign in us.</p>
                  <p>Again ſecondly, Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the Law: for Chriſt having ſatisfied the juſtice and wrath of God for our tranſgreſſing the Law, the Law can have no force to curſe us. Here is the firſt reaſon why ſin cannot have dominion over Gods people, Becauſe Chriſt hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God for the ſins of his people, redeeming them from under the Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe all that are Chriſts people muſt be like unto Chriſt: Thereupon it is that the children of God are ſaid to <hi>put on Chriſt;</hi> they are ſaid to live <hi>the life of Chriſt,</hi> to be the members of Chriſt, to be the brethren of Chriſt, the branches of Chriſt: All theſe Metaphors are to ſhew us, that there is a likeneſs between Chriſt and all that are his people. Now as they are to be like Chriſt in other things, ſo in theſe two things. Firſt, ſin had no dominion over Chriſt, it never Lorded over him to obedience. Secondly, Death and damnation never had power over Chriſt: Firſt, ſin had no dominion, no power over him; Chriſt indeed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114897:53"/>was oft tempted to ſin, but he never obeyed ſin: The world ſet it ſelf to inſnare him, the Devill ſet himſelf to draw him into ſin, but neither world nor Devill, could never have any power over him to bring him under ſin. Indeed Chriſt was under the guilt of ſin, for <hi>hee bore our tranſgreſſions,</hi> but Chriſt was never under the reign of ſin, ſin had never any power over him to make him obey it. In this muſt all the people of God be like unto Chriſt; that as ſin had no power of Chriſt to make him obey it, ſo ſin muſt have no power over any of Gods people to make them obey it.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a double obedience. The one is, when as ſin is obeyed at all; the other is, when as ſin is obeyed with full conſent of the will. The firſt, when ſin is obeyed at all, though it be with grief and oppoſition, from this obedience of ſin ſhall the people of God be delivered in due time, in the world to come, after death, then they ſhall be perfectly like Chriſt, when they ſhall be perfectly freed from doing the commands of ſin. But from that other obedience of ſin, to obey it with full conſent of will, as a child doth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a ſubject doth the law and commands of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; from this obedience of ſin, Chriſt delivereth his people in this world, and ſo in part they are made like unto him in this life, while they are freed from the reign of ſin, ſo that though ſin captive them, yet ſin doth not Lord it over them, neither doe they obey ſin fully with conſent as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſecondly, death had no power over Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 6. 9. Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.</hi> The Lord Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was once ſeized upon by death, he was once under the power of a temporall death; but he being once raiſed from death; death now never can reach Chriſt any more. In this alſo muſt all Gods people be like unto Chriſt: Indeed it is true, once death and damnation had dominion over us, we were under the guilt and ſentence of condemnation, as Chriſt was once under death, but as Chriſt once being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from death, death never after had dominion over him;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114897:53"/>ſo all that are the people of God, being by Chriſt delivered from the ſentence of damnation, it ſhall never come to have dominion over them. Once they were under the power of ſin to damnation, but now by Chriſt they are delivered from it, death hath no more dominion over them; howſoever a bodily death prevaileth ſo far as to part body and ſoul for a while, yet not ſo as to expoſe them to damnation. To the end therefore that there may be a proportion between the root, and the branches, between the head, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, between the elder brother, and the reſt of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, between Chriſt and the people of God, hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of neceſſitie, that ſin muſt not have dominion over any of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>To apply this Point now thus opened and cleared. It ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth firſt for Inſtruction, to teach us the falſeneſſe of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that is in the world, That all men are ſinners alike, that there is no difference between ſinners in the world. When any of Gods Children come to a wicked man, a drunkard, a whoremaſter, a ſwearer, &amp;c. and tells him of his ſin, ſaith he preſently, we are all ſinners alike, I have my vice, and you have your vice, one man hath one ſin, and another man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſinners we are all alike. This is a damnable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a mark and brand of a wretched perſon. But now this Doctrine teacheth us, that howſoever it is true, that Gods people and others are all ſinners, and alike by nature, yet there is a great deal of difference between Gods people that are under ſin, and the unregenerate man. Indeed Gods children they are under ſin, but (mark it) they are not under the dominion of ſin; thou art under the dominion of ſin, but they are not under that: There is the difference, we are all ſinners, but we are not all alike ſinners. We that are the people of God are under the guilt and power of ſome ſins, but yet we are not under the dominion of any ſin: Sin hath neither dominion over us to rule us as a Soveraign doth his ſubjects, nor to damn us as it ſhall doe them that are not in Chriſt: But as for thee that art a carnall wretch, thou art under the dominion of ſin, thou doeſt obey ſin in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114897:54"/>the luſts thereof; if ſinne bid thee doe a thing thou doeſt it, and doeſt it withall thy heart: and ſo as thou art under the reign of ſinne, ſo thou art under the damnation of ſinne, except by faith and repentance thou commeth out of this condition Therefore learn that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the people of God, and the men of the world: we are all under ſinne, but not under the dominion of ſinne, as the world is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſecond Uſe is, for Conſolation: and it is a point of wonderfull comfort to all the people of God; I doe not ſpeake now to them that are unregenerated, that are Aliens to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſtrangers to the Covenant of promiſe, that are without Chriſt and God in the world: this is childrens bread, and it belongeth not to ſuch dogs as they are: But I ſpeak this to all that are in the Covenant, to all that are borne againe: And that you may know to whom I ſpeak, take this one ſigne; ſuch of you as are as truly burthened with the preſence of ſinne as with the guilt of ſinne: ſuch of you as are as truly offended with the filth of ſinne, as with the puniſhment of ſinne; ſuch of you as doe deſire as truly to be rid of ſinne it ſelſe, as to eſcape dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for ſinne: in a word, ſuch of you as are ſenſible of the corruption of your nature, and groan under it, as under the greateſt miſery you can poſſibly lie under: ſuch of you as maintain an invincible oppoſition againſt the ſinnes of your nature, and make them your daily conflict, you are Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to you I ſpeak at this time. Here (my brethren) is comfort for you, ſinne may be in thee, it may foile thee, it may have ſometime a great power over thee, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be of good comfort, ſinne ſhall never have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over thee, it ſhall never make thee his ſubject, it ſhall never damne thee. I pray take notice of the ſpeech of God to Saint <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. The Apoſtle was troubled with his corruptions, and <hi>he prayed thrice</hi> to be rid of it: (here is a ſigne of Gods childe, though he have corruptions in him, yet he is reſtleſſe under them, and he never giveth over praying, till God deliver him from them; <hi>Paul</hi> prayed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114897:54"/>thrice) that is often, he could not be quiet till he were free from it, it was as a <hi>thorn</hi> in his foot: what anſwer doth God give? <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> be of good comfort, art thou annoyed with corruption, yet notwithſtanding, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee;</hi> thy corruption ſhall never have dominion over thee; well may it dwell in thee, never ſhall it reign over thee; well may it foile thee, never ſhall it conquer thee; thou ſhalt never come to be overcome with thy corruptions, ſo as to give up thy ſelfe with full conſent of will to obey thy ſinnes: <hi>My grace is ſufficient</hi> to keep thy corruption from reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thee, though I will not keep it from dwelling in thee: <hi>My grace is ſufficient</hi> to keep ſinne from damning of thee, though I will not yet keep it from moleſting of thee. Here is comfort for thy poor ſoule therefore, that art bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and grieved with the ſenſe of thy corruptions: As the Lord reſolved, that he would not for a time drive out the <hi>Canaanites</hi> from among the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but yet they ſhould be Tributaries to them, and acknowledge them for their Soveraigne: ſo the Lord hath reſolved, that ſinne ſhall dwell in thee, but yet it ſhall be a Tributary, it ſhall never ſway the Scepter, it ſhall never weare the Crown, it ſhall never ſet on the Throne of thy ſoule; and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing to reign over thee, it ſhall never prevaile to damne thee: Be of good comfort therefore, God will deliver thee from all dominion of ſinne, yea, he hath done it already. Oh how did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> crie out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24 <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Here is a true ſigne of Gods childe: they that have not this are none of Gods; by reaſon of the remainders of corruption, which is as death in him, (therefore the Apoſtle here calleth it, <hi>the body of this death,</hi> he meaneth originall corruption, but calleth it, <hi>a body of death,</hi> becauſe it is a death to him, and he had rather ſuffer death then have it in him) by reaſon of this he counteth himſelfe miſerable and wretched, <hi>Oh</hi> miſerable and <hi>wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death;</hi> he would give
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114897:55"/>all the world if he had it, but to be delivered from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſinne: this is the ſtate of Gods children, nothing in the world burtheneth them ſo much as the preſence of their corruptions; they are not pleaſed when they break Gods Commands; they doe not make it their trade to commit ſinne, it is the greateſt griefe, and ſhame, and wound their ſoule hath. Well, how doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> comfort himſelfe againſt the remainders of corruption in him? <hi>I thank God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>through jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, why doe I thus diſmay my ſelfe: ſinne is in me, but yet notwithſtanding, ſinne ſhall not have dominion over me, by Chriſt I am delivered from the reign of ſinne, <hi>Oh thanks be to God, through jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is conſolation, take it, and incourage your ſelves by it, againſt the remainders of corruption that are in you. God hath left ſinne in you, but why? It is but to ſerve you, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> that were left in <hi>Canaan;</hi> they ſhall not reign over you, ſaith God, they ſhall be Tributaries to you, to draw water, and to hew wood for the ſervice of the Sanctuary, to helpe you in offering up Sacrifices, they ſhall be your ſervants. I ſpeak this to your comforts onely that are the Lords, ſinne is left in you, not to reign over you, but to ſerve you. You are Prieſts to God the Father, and you muſt have Sacrifices to offer up unto God: of old God made his people offer up coſtly Sacrifices, Oxen, and Sheep, and Calves: but now ſinne ſerveth the turne; the ſinne that is in thee ſerveth thee for Sacrifice, every ſinne that thou mortifie it is as pleaſing a Sacrifice to God, as if thou offereſt up an O xe, or a Sheep: thus they are thy ſervants, and they ſave thee coſt, they ſerve in ſtead of Sacrifices, they ſerve to draw water and cut wood: thy ſinnes they doe more fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thygrace then any thing elſe; they helpe thee to draw the water of godly ſorrow, of true repentance; they helpe thee to prize the mercies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; they helpe thee to humility, to meekneſſe, to a ſpirit of compaſſion to others; in a word, nothing doth thee ſo much ſervice, as the ſinne that is in thee. Be of good comfort therefore, if thy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114897:55"/>ſinnes be grieved for, ſtriven againſt, laboured againſt, they further thy reward for all eternity. Here is the ſecond Uſe.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe is for Exhortation, in as much as you that are Gods people ſee that ſinve ſhall never have dominion over you, be exhorted therefore to fight againſt your ſinnes: you have a good cauſe, you are ſure of victory, oh then play the men. Souldiers that have a good cauſe, and have good hope of victory, how manfully doe they fight; and yet they are not ſure of victory neither. But thou that art one of Chriſts, what cauſe can here be better then thine? the cauſe of Chriſt againſt the Devill; what greater aſſurance can there be of obtaining the victory, ſeeing God himſelfe is ingaged in the quarrell? the word is gone cut of his mouth, he hath ſaid it, <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> Oh then ſtand it out againſt ſinne, never yeeld the bucklers to thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that make hard upon thee, make the battell freſh and ſtrong againſt thy luſts; though thou art foyled again and again, never give over conflicting, for God hath ſaid it, and his words ſhall never fall to the ground, that <hi>ſinne ſhall not have dominion over thee;</hi> he hath engaged himſelfe in the cauſe, and if God be true and able to keep ſinne from reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thee, thou ſhalt be ſure to have the victory in the end fall on thy ſide. Thus much for the firſt part of the verſe, the promiſe that the Apoſtle makes to the people of God, <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now come as breifly as we can to the ſecond part of the verſe, and that is, the ground and reaſon of this promiſe, <hi>For you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Give me leave in a word, to obſerve ſomething in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, before we come to the words themſelves. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had expreſt a great deale of ſweet incouragement to theſe Beleevers, in that he promiſeth in the name of God, that <hi>ſinne ſhould not have dominion over them;</hi> the ground and reaſon of all this is, becauſe they <hi>were not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> This teacheth us thus much, and I will note it in a word by the way. That</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:114897:56"/>
                     <hi>All the incouragement we have from God it is all of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not by workes, for then it would come by the Law, but it is by Grace, that is, of Gods free mercy, of his free gift.</p>
                  <p>This is it that the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the old <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and divers other Heretiques will not give to God, that all that we have for matter of incouragement is of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Again, we may alſo obſerve another thing: the ground of mercy, which the Apoſtle here had expreſt to the people of God, he makes it come by Grace, and not by the Law. But how commeth this grace to them? It commeth by Chriſt, and by the Goſpell. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt he is the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of all this grace: the Goſpel, that is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer, the Preacher of this grace, the Inſtrument, whereby God doth make known and communicate it to us. In as much then as the Apoſtle makes the ground of all the mercy that beleevers have to be by grace, and that grace commeth by Chriſt and the Goſpel, you may learn in the next place in the generall, this inſtruction alſo. That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the priviledges and mercies that we do enjoy, they all come to us by Chriſt, and by his Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much is here included in the word Grace; by Chriſt and by the Goſpel come we to injoy, all the favour and mercy from God, that we doe injoy.</p>
                  <p>I will ſhew you a little in brief, how that by Chriſt we come to injoy all the grace and favour we doe injoy. See firſt that place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. there the Text plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, that as all our miſery, and all the diſpleaſure of God came on us by one man, that is by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the favour of God, with all the comforts and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that we doe injoy, they come to us by the ſecond man, that is, by Jeſus Chriſt: you may read the place at your leaſure, you ſhall find it expreſſe in the Text.</p>
                  <p>This is it alſo you ſhall ſee as plainly expreſt in the firſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114897:56"/>Verſe of that Chapter; <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alſo wee have acceſs by faith into the grace wherein we ſtand:</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, peace with God it cometh by Chriſt; acceſs to that grace with God wherein we ſtand, is all by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And as it is thus for Chriſt, ſo it is alſo for the Goſpel, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever priviledges or favours from God we enjoy, they are all through the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Whereunto he called you by our Goſpel, to the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All our glorie cometh by Chriſt, all this glory of Chriſt is partaked of us through the Goſpel. And hence alſo is that in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>But is now made manifeſt by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light, through the Goſpel.</hi> Still you ſee the Goſpel is made the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come to injoy thoſe favours and priviledges from God that we doe injoy.</p>
                  <p>But you may object, if ſo be all the grace and favour Gods people have had with God come by Chriſt, and by his Goſpel; then how came they to enjoy it that lived before the coming of Chriſt, and the preaching of the Goſpel, the Patriarchs and Fathers from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that as they (ſo many of them as were beleevers) had the ſame grace and favour with God that we have, ſo they alſo had the ſame Chriſt, and the Goſpel that we have. Chriſt and the Goſpel was as well made known to them as to us; and by Chriſt and the Goſpel, they came to enjoy that grace with God, which they had, as well as we doe.</p>
                  <p>Hercupon it is that Chriſt profeſſeth that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the writings of the Prophets did bear witneſs of him as he ſpeaks in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.46. And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the unbeleeving Jewes, layeth down the cauſe therof, not to be a want of the revelation of Chriſt, in the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14.) <hi>their minds were blinded, for untill this day remaineth the ſame vail un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken away in the reading of the Old Teſtament, and even
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114897:57"/>unto this day, when Moſes is read, the vail is upon their heart.</hi> Chriſt and the Goſpel are revealed in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament as well as in the New, onely here is the difference, there was a vail put over their minds that they could not ſee this Chriſt, and this Goſpel that was revealed in the Old Teſtament. And therefore the ſame Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. profeſſeth, that the beleeving Jews of the Old Church <hi>did eat of the ſame ſpirituall meat, and did all drinke the ſame ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall drink: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they dranke of that ſpirituall rock that followed them, and that rock was Chriſt.</hi> They were partakers of the ſame Chriſt, and of the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that we are: The difference is onely this, They that were before the coming of Chriſt, they had the Law in a greater plentie, and they had the Goſpel in a greater ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie than we have: They had more of the Law, and leſſe of the Goſpel, we have leſſe of the Law, and more of Chriſt and the Goſpel. They had not onely the Morall Law, but the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Law, and the Ceremoniall Law; whereas we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Judicial and Ceremoniall Law, onely ſo far as there was in any of them a Morall Equitie. And as they had more of the Law, ſo they had leſſe of the Goſpel; Chriſt indeed was preached to them, but it was in Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, but to us Chriſt is preached nakedly; the Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was revealed to them but very darkly, very obſcurely; but now to us it is preached in an open and full manner.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, what is the reaſon that God put this difference between the people of God before Chriſt and ſince?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The Reaſon was this, Becauſe that before Chriſt the Church was in his infancie, in his childhood, therefore as great Heires, ſo long as they are under age are put to Tutors and Governours, and doe not enjoy ſo noble a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſation, as they enjoy after they come to Age: ſo the Lord ſerved the Church, while the Church was in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, till the coming of Chriſt ſhe was under the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of the Law, of Shadowes and Types, and of thoſe Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Types, whereby ſhe was nurtured and fitted up
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114897:57"/>in a meaner and lower manner, then ſhee is now being of age. But now ſince the comming of Chriſt, the Church is come of Age, and therefore now God doth reveal himſelf in a more excellent manner than before.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould God thus, while his Church was under age, keep it under Tutors and Governours?</p>
                  <p>The reaſon was this, That he might prepare the Church to receive the Doctrine of Chriſt and the Goſpel; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is ſo exceeding oppoſite to the doctrine of Chriſt and the Goſpel, that if it had not been long framed by the tutoring of many hundred yeers by the Law, it had never been convinced of the neceſſitie of ſalvation by Chriſt, and the Goſpel. All theſe things you have laid down to us in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. from Verſe 19. to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe of the fourth Chapter, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Apoſtle openeth theſe things to us at large.</p>
                  <p>Thus briefly you have ſeen this Point alſo opened to us, <hi>That all the favour and priviledges that the people of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, it is all by grace, that is, by Chriſt and by his Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will onely make a Uſe or two of this point in a few words, and ſo paſſe it over.</p>
                  <p>Firſt this Doctrine ſerveth to check their unthankfulneſs, that doe enjoy the Goſpel, and are not abundant in thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God for it. Whatſoever thou haſt, whatſoever boldneſs toward God, whatever acceſs into his preſence, whatever hope of pardon, whatever victorie over corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever change of nature, whatſoever thou haſt that bringeth thee, or furthereth thee in grace and favour with God, all is by Chriſt and the Goſpel. Whence is it then that thou art ſo unmindfull of Chriſt, and ſo unthankfull for Chriſt and the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>There are three unthankfulneſſes, and unmindfulneſſes which the Scripture marks. The firſt is that of the chief But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers forgetting the kindneſs of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> The other is, that of the King of <hi>Egypts</hi> forgetting alſo the kindneſs of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> And the laſt is that of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> his forgetting the kindneſs of <hi>Jehojada</hi> the high Prieſt. Theſe are branded for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfulneſs of the great favours they had received. But all
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114897:58"/>theſe put together, are not ſo deeply to be charged with the guilt of unthankfulneſs, and unmindfulneſs, as we are that live under the Goſpel, and enjoy ſuch great favours by Chriſt and the Goſpel, and yet are no more thankfull for them than we are.</p>
                  <p>The other Uſe ſhall be for an Exhortation, to provoke you above all things to prize Chriſt and the Goſpel, as you prize life, libertie, pardon of ſin, favour of God, ſalvation of ſouls, ſo prize Chriſt and the Goſpel, for by them you have all theſe. Even our outward priviledges (my brethren) come by the Goſpel; the Goſpel of peace hath brought a great deal of peace to this Land; temporall honour, proſperitie, renown, and plenty hath come to us by the Goſpel. But thoſe things that above all are prize-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, are the favour of God, the peace of conſcience, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie over corruptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things they are all brought to us by Chriſt and the Goſpel. Therefore let us prize theſe above our lives or liberties. Great cauſe have we of this age to fear that Chriſt and his Goſpel are departing from us; we cannot but ſee that there are thoſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, that uſually cauſe Chriſt to depart, we have a great deal of intemperancie, a world of prophaneſſe and impietie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are uſually fore-runners of Chriſts going away, and carrying his Goſpel from a Nation. Let us therefore more fear the loſſe of theſe, then the loſſe of our own lives. We may loſe our lives, and yet keep the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God; we may loſe our lives, and yet injoy all the Priviledges of the people of God; but if Chriſt and the Goſpel be taken away, ſo many of us as have not made a ſure part for our ſelves in Chriſt, and in the Goſpel, we loſe all favour with God, and all the priviledges of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Therefore let us beſtir our ſelves within the bounds of our callings; to the uttermoſt of our abilities, both by praying, and every way that God hath appointed (more then for our lives) to preſerve among us Chriſt and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <p>Thus much briefly for thoſe generall Obſervations that lay
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114897:58"/>in our way, which I could not well paſſe over without a ſhort touch. I come now to the particular words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<q>You are not under the Law, but under Grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine (to paſſe by other things) that the words particularly afford us, it is thus much, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All they that are in Chriſt, they are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>You are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> who are they? In the beginning of this Chapter the third Verſe; <hi>Know you not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſo many of us, as were baptized into Chriſt, were baptized into his death?</hi> Theſe are the perſons of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>You are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> You that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Chriſt, you that are joyned unto Chriſt, you that are one with Chriſt, <hi>you are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> The Doctrine you ſee is the very expreſſe words of the Text, and it is ſo clear and evident, that I ſuppoſe, I ſhall not need to ſpend time to prove it.</p>
                  <p>For the opening of it, I will firſt ſhew you what is meant by the Law, what is meant by being under the Law, and then what is meant by grace, and by being under grace, and ſo make ſome brief Uſes and conclude.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>What is meant by the Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Law is meant that ſame perfect rule of obedience which God hath preſcribed man, by the works thereof to attain life everlaſting. This Law is that of which <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator, when it was delivered to man after his fall, therefore it is called the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This Law is that which is called the old Covenant, becauſe it was made with us, before the fall with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. This Law is that which is called the Covenant of works, becauſe it promiſeth ſalvation onely on the condition of works. This is meant by the Law.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by being <hi>under the Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, by being <hi>under the Law</hi> is meant a full ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114897:59"/>to the Law in all its properties, and in all its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>Now there are four properties of the Law: two of them are direct, and two of them are accidentall, and occaſioned to the Law by our ſins.</p>
                  <p>There are two properties of the Law, that are direct.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, that it accepteth of nothing but perfect obedience; it pardoneth no failings, no imperfections. This is that, <hi>doe this and live:</hi> doe it; the Law it doth not accept of endeavours and of deſires; there is nothing that ſtandeth with the Law but a perfect doing. Hence is that ſame, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. there ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to doe them.</hi> Here is the firſt direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Law, it accepteth of nothing but perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it pardoneth no failings, it will admit of no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, that are written in the book of the Law to doe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond direct property of the Law is this, that it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Commandements, but it giveth no power at all to obey the Commandements: it ſetteth us a rule, but it helpeth with no vertue, no ſtrength to walke by the rule. In this reſpect it is, that the Law is called <hi>the Letter,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who hath made us able Miniſters of the new Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit.</hi> By <hi>the Letter</hi> there is meant the Law, as by <hi>the ſpirit</hi> is meant the Covenant of Grace: the Law is called <hi>the Letter,</hi> becauſe as the writing of Letters doth direct us and ſhew us a Coppy, but admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth no kind of art, or skill to the Scholler to follow the coppy: ſo this is the property of the Law, it preſcribeth a rule, but adminiſtreth no ability to walk by the rule. Theſe are the two direct properties of the Law. Now in reſpect of theſe two, man, ſo long as he was in the ſtate of innocency, before his fall, he was well enough: I tis true, the Law would pardon no faylings, would accept of no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience; but man in that eſtate needed not to care, for he had power to keep the whole Law, and to obſerve
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114897:59"/>every tittle thereof, and to yeeld perfect obedience to every thing contained in it. Again, the Law was a meer Letter, directing onely what ſhould be done, but affording no helpe for the doing of what is required; man had power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (God had given him it in his creation) to obey the Law, to write exactly after that coppy. But ſince man is come into a ſtate of ſinne, ſince the fall of man, the Law hath by accident, and by occaſion of mans fall, two other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, that the Law doth curſe every man that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, even unto Hell; this is that in the forenamed place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>As many as are under the Law are curſed, for curſed is every one that doth not all that is written in the book of the Law.</hi> Hence it commeth to paſſe, that the Law doth inflict damnation upon all them that are under it: Hence are theſe names given to the Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9. In the 6. verſe, <hi>the Letter killeth,</hi> that is, the Law killeth us. In the 7. verſe, <hi>it is called, the miniſtration of death.</hi> In the 9. verſe, <hi>it is called, the miniſtration of condemnation:</hi> all theſe names are given to the Law, becauſe through mans fall there is occaſioned a property to the Law, to kill, and to deſtroy, and to condemn.</p>
                  <p>Againe, another property that is occaſioned to the Law by ſinne, and by the fall of man, is this, that the Law doth multiply tranſgreſſions in the hearts and lives of people. This is a ſtrange thing, therefore I pray obſerve the opening of it. I ſay, the property of the Law it is, that it doth multiply tranſgreſſion and ſinne in the hearts of people, for therefore it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The Law entred, that ſinne might abound;</hi> the Law doth cauſe the abounding of ſinne: there had never been ſo much ſinne in the world, if it had not been by the Law: not directly, but by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth the Law multiply tranſgreſſions in the hearts of people. The Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4, 5. compareth the Law to a Husband, the ſinfull heart to a Wife: that look as by the Husband, the Wife commeth to bring forth children, ſo by the Law, mans corrupt heart commeth to bring forth ſins.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:114897:60"/>
                  <p>If you aske how this commeth about?</p>
                  <p>It is thus. The Law it commeth with Commandements, and with prohibitions: it commandeth people to doe theſe and theſe things, it commandeth people to leave undone theſe and theſe things, now the Law meeting with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of mans heart, ſetting a rule to that heart that will not be ruled, it makes the heart to rebell and tranſgreſſe: if there were no Law, there would be no ſinne, if the Law did not command, there were no ſinne in not doing, if the Law did not forbid, there were no ſinne in doing: But now the Law comming to the corrupt heart, bidding them doe, corruption refuſing to doe, the Law cauſeth corruption to ſinne: The Law again comming to a corrupt heart, and bidding them refraine, corruption refuſing, cauſeth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to ſinne: for if there were no rule, there could be no erring beſides the rule. Thus in theſe reſpects it is, that by occaſion the Law commeth to have this property to be as a Father, and as a Husband, multiplying tranſgreſſions in the hearts of people.</p>
                  <p>Gather up that which I have ſaid, and lay them together, the two direct properties of the Law, and the two accidentall properties of the Law, occaſioned by corruption; and you ſee there are four properties of the Law: So then, to be under the Law, it is nothing elſe, but to be under theſe four properties of the Law, to be in ſuch a ſtate and condition, wherein we are liable to all theſe four properties of the Law. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That nothing will ſerve our turn but perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, no ſinne to be pardoned, no frailty to be paſt by, no imperfection to be covered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To be in ſuch a ſtate and condition, wherein there is a great deale commanded, but no power, no ſtrength communicated, to enable us to doe any thing that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To be in ſuch a ſtate and condition, wherein we are under a curſe and condemnation, even to the pit of hell.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:114897:60"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, To be in ſuch a ſtate and condition, wherein dayly and hourly there are ſinnes multiplied, and brought forth in us through the corruption of our nature. To be in a ſtate that hath theſe four miſerable properties, is this, to be <hi>under the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us ſhew you what it is to be under Grace. And firſt, what Grace is: and then what it is to be <hi>under Grace.</hi> I pray obſerve this alſo.</p>
                  <p>Grace, it is nothing elſe, but the free promiſe of Salvation, in, and by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. This is Grace.</p>
                  <p>To be <hi>under grace,</hi> is to be under the four properties of grace. For as the Law had four properties, ſo this grace hath four properties contrary to the Law, all of them direct and proper to Grace.</p>
                  <p>The firſt propertie of Grace is this: There ſhall be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; the ſins that are paſt ſhall be forgiven. That this is in grace you may ſee in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>For I will forgive their iniquities, and remember their ſins no more.</hi> The Propertie of grace it is to pardon failings, to cover imperfections, to accept of a deſire, and of an endeavour, and of a weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: This is the firſt propertie of grace; that this is ſo, you may ſee it in <hi>Noh.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Remember me O my God, and ſpare me according to the greatneſs of thy mercie:</hi> That is, remember my good deeds, and ſpare my imperfections, and paſſe by my weakneſſes, <hi>Neheminh</hi> could not have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, if God had not promiſed it. So alſo that in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>They ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord, and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him.</hi> How doth a man ſpare a ſon? If a ſervant ſerve a man, he makes him doe the uttermoſt, he will be content with nothing but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience; but if a ſon come to ſerve the father, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will winke at many failings, will take well an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſervice, ſo the ſon deſireth and endeavoureth to doe better: ſo ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will ſpare them, as a father ſpareth his ſon that ſerveth him.</hi> It is ſaid of the Lord-Chriſt in <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 12.20. <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoking <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth judgement unto victory.</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:114897:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>There is more promiſed in the words than is expreſt. <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break</hi> but he ſhall ſtrengthen it; <hi>A ſmoking flax ſhall he not quench,</hi> but he ſhall increaſe it; that is the meaning of it, he ſhall be ſo far from ſlighting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and endeavours, and imperfect obedience, that he ſhall accept them, and ſtrengthen them, as appeareth in the next words, <hi>till he hath brought forth judgement unto victory;</hi> The work of ſanctification is victorie, Chriſt will ſtrengthen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect obedience, till he hath made holineſſe and obedience victorious over all corruption. This is the firſt propertie of Grace to pardon ſin, to accept imperfect obedience, to cover frailties.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Propertie of Grace is, that it giveth ſtrength and power to doe whatſoever it commandeth (this is that point we ſpake of before) In that forenamed place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. there the Covenant of grace is called the Spirit, <hi>not of the Letter</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but of the Spirit, for the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter killeth, but the Spirit</hi> (that is the Covenant of grace) <hi>giveth life.</hi> Grace, whatſoever it commandeth giveth power to doe it, ſo farre as ſhall be ſufficient for Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>
                  <p>The third property of grace is this, that grace delivereth us from under the curſe, it fetcheth us out of condemnation. This is that which is expreſt in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>To redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> (and ſo under the curſe) <hi>that we might receive the adoption of ſons,</hi> and ſo the bleſſing of ſons: therefore is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſty, The laſt property of grace is this, That grace, it doth hinder corruption from multiplying, from bringing forth fruit: grace doth deſtroy the Law, in regard of any power to multiply ſinne and corruption in us as it did before; grace doth <hi>ſubdue our iniquities, Micah</hi> 7.19. grace doth write the Law of God in our hearts; grace doth give us diſpoſitions inward, anſwerable to the outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law of God. So that by grace, when as the Law of God commeth with a command to doe this; grace
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114897:61"/>makes us able to doe it in ſome meaſure: when the command of God commeth with a prohibition not to doe this; grace makes us able to abſtaine from it in ſome meaſure. Thus now grace deſtroying corruption, and making us able in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obey the commands, it doth deſtroy that accidentall property of the Law, where by it doth multiply and ſtreng then corruption in us. And thus Grace is directly contrary to the Law, <hi>The Law came by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then to be under grace, is no more but to be in that condition, wherein we injoy this fourfould happy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To be in a condition, wherein all our ſinnes are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, our imperfect obedience accepted, our frailties co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</item>
                     <item>2. To be in a condition, wherein no more ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, then ſtrength given to obey.</item>
                     <item>3. To be in a condition, wherein we are fetched from under the curſe and condemnation of the Law, and brought under the juſtification of children.</item>
                     <item>4. To be in a condition, wherein we receive ſo much grace, as that we are able in ſome meaſure to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law, and that the Law cannot bring forth ſinne in us as it hath before.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>By this you ſee now what, they that are in Chriſt, doe injoy, they <hi>are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will briefly in three or four words conclude all with ſome Uſe of this Doctrine. And firſt of all, this ſerveth for great comfort to all thoſe that are in Chriſt (for indeed this whole Text is full of unſpeakable conſolation to every poor ſoule that hath any true evidence of his being in Chriſt) their condition in which they ſtand is wonderfull ſweet: they <hi>are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Here is then a fountain opened of ſingular conſolation for all ſuch. They are not in that ſtate, wherein exact obedience ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and all infirmities charged upon them; but they are in that ſtate, wherein their deſires, and indeavours, and beginings
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114897:62"/>ſhall be accepted and perfected. Thou that art in Chriſt, thou art not in that condition wherein thou art devoid of all ſtrength to obey the Commandements of God, but thou art in ſuch a ſtate, wherein there is life, and power given thee to doe what is commanded by God. Thou art not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe and condemnation of the Law, but under the bleſſing and juſtification of children. Let the people of God but run over theſe particulars here laid down, and view all the ſeverall comforts that are in that condition wherein they are, and there is a fountain and ſpring of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for them.</p>
                  <p>The Second Uſe is, for a ſharp reprehenſion to all ſuch as are the people of God, and are his children, that finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſo by a teſtimonie from their own ſpirits and from Gods ſpirit, and yet notwithſtanding lead lives uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and lumpiſh. This Doctrine (my brethren) afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you a ſharp reprehenſion. Thou art in Chriſt, and yet art thou diſcouraged or diſheartned either with corruption, or with guilt? How unworthy doeſt thou walk of that condition wherein thou art? Thou <hi>art not under the Law, but under grace,</hi> why then is it, that thou art as much deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcouraged, as if thou wert under the Law, and not under grace? What is it that makes thee diſconſolate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but the condition wherein thou art may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to thee much more comfort? Art thou full of ſin? yet notwithſtanding thou art in a condition wherein all ſin ſhall be pardoned. Is thy obedience very imperfect? yet thou art in a condition wherein imperfect obedience ſhall be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and frailties covered. Doeſt thou finde that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth thee much, and thou doeſt little? but yet thou art in a condition wherein the Lord hath promiſed, (ſo thou wilt uſe the means, and truſt upon him,) to make thee able in an acceptable manner to doe all that he biddeth thee doe. Doth the Law threaten, doth the Law curſe? yet thou art in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein neither the threatning, nor curſe of the Law, ſhall ever reach thee to condemnation. Findeſt thou mighty rebellions in thy nature againſt the Law of God? yet thou
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114897:62"/>art in a condition wherein is promiſed a new nature, which ſhall be made conformable and ſubjected to the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould make thee therefore hang down thy head? Sharply are ſuch Chriſtians to be reproved, that being in Chriſt, lead lives as if they were out of Chriſt. Doeſt not thou make the world to thinke that that is falſe which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That his yoke is eaſie, and his burthen light?</hi> If Chriſts yoke be eaſie, and his burthen light, why is it (ſaith the world) that the ſervants of Chriſt walk ſo diſconſolately and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of heavie burthens?</p>
                  <p>You ſhall find an exhortation of the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>We beſeech you that you receive not the grace of God in vain.</hi> There is a double receiving of Gods grace in vain. The one is, when as Gods grace is offered and preached to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and out of love to the world, and to their ſins, they ſlight it, and will not receive it. Another receiving the grace of God in vain, it is, when as people have entertained the grace of God, and have entred into Covenant with Chriſt, and yet notwithſtanding doe not take the comforts that the grace of God affordeth them. This is alſo a receiving the grace of God in vain. This is thy caſe whoever thou art that art a beleever, and yet notwithſtanding doeſt not make melodie in thy heart, and triumph over thy enemies. What have the redeemed of the Lord to doe, but to praiſe the Lord? What have the members of Chriſt to doe, but to rejoyce in Chriſt? Doe you thinke when the Lord giveth that Commandement, <hi>Phil,</hi> 4. <hi>Rejoyce alwaies in the Lord, and again, I ſay rejoyce,</hi> (he doth not bid them rejoyce in riches, in friends, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is worldly, this is damuable, but he biddeth us rejoyce in the Lord, in the priviledges we have by Chriſt through the New Covenant of Grace; he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us rejoyce and always rejoyce) Do you thinke, I ſay, when God gave you that Commandment, he had forgotten the ſtate in which he left you, that he had left you under the power of many ſins, ſubject to many failings, unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience? Doe you thinke (I ſay again) that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114897:63"/>the condition wherein he left you? No, God knew well enough what ſtate he left you in, that you are as <hi>Iſrael</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and yet he biddeth you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; why ſo? There is ground enough for your rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe <hi>you are not under the Law, but under grace,</hi> and if under grace, ſurely there is ground enough for your rejoycing, notwithſtanding all your failings.</p>
                  <p>Conſider therefore then my brethren, I beſeech you; doe not you receive the grace of God in vain, doe not you ſlight, as it were, and not make uſe of the grace of God, which thus adminiſtreth matter of rejoycing in all conditions to you that are in Chriſt, when as you walke ſo lumpiſhly becauſe of ſin formerly committed, or becauſe of corruptions that for the preſent lie upon you?</p>
                  <p>Indeed I deny not but it becommeth Chriſtians to mourn, and they that doe not mourn, ſhall never rejoyce in the day of judgement, and the people of God are <hi>mourners in Zion.</hi> Yet what kind of mourning? There is a double ſorrow: A godly ſorrow, and a worldly ſorrow: A godly ſorrow is this, when as a ſoul melteth into tears upon the conſideration of his ſins and wants, becauſe he beleeveth that God through Chriſt will accept him notwithſtanding them all; this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the more of it the better, this ſorrow melloweth the heart, ſoftneth the heart, makes it frameable to the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the word of God. But now the other ſorrow, which is a worldly ſorrow, when as a ſoul is beaten out of heart becauſe of ſin formerly committed, becauſe of mighty cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that doe annoy him, to mourn without hope and confidence of acceptance, this is worldly ſorrow, and cauſeth death, this is altogether unbeſeeming Chriſtians. Receive now this ſharp reprehenſion, and be humbled for it, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to remember your condition: <hi>You are not come to mount Sinai, but to mount Zion; You are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Therefore rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, and be ſo cheerfull, that the world may ſee, that the ſervice of Chriſt is a ſweet ſervice. Here is the ſecond Uſe.</p>
                  <p>The third is for Inſtruction, to them that are not in Chriſt,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114897:63"/>to ſuch of you as remaine yet in your naturall eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The condition of them that are in Chriſt is this, they <hi>are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Thy condition who art not yet in Chriſt, is juſt the contrary; thou art not under grace, but under the Law. There are none that doe more aſſume to themſelves the priviledges of grace, then they that are not under grace. You ſhall have your profane Wretch, your painted Civillian, your formall Hypocrite, men that are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, that are ſervants to ſinne, while with full conſent they obey ſinne in the luſts thereof: yet you ſhall have theſe challenge to themſelves the priviledges of the Covenant of grace: you ſhall have one ſwear an Oath, and when he hath done, ſay, God forgive me: you ſhall have another ſay, I am a great ſinner, but I hope God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to me: Another, I cannot keep the Commandements, but I hope God will accept me: thus theſe wretches, that are in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity, they claime the priviledges of grace. But I would have them know, ſo many of you as have no evidences that you are tranſlated out of the ſtate of nature, and ingrafted into Chriſt by his holy Spirit, that you are not under grace, but under the Law. What is that?</p>
                  <p>You are in ſuch a condition, wherein nothing but perfect obedience ſhall ſtand you in ſtead. If you pray as well as you can, yet if you doe not pray as perfectly as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law, you ſhall never be heard: If you keep all the Commandements of God, and faile but in one, yet you ſhall be damned; there is no accepting of imperfect obedience of you, becauſe you are not under Chriſt, but under the Law. And I tell thee this, the Saints of God ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit greater ſinnes and goe to Heaven, when thou leſſer and goe to Hell. <hi>Peter</hi> forſweareth his Maſter with an Oath and Curſe, and yet he is pardoned; thou ſhalt not ſweare and curſe, or deny Chriſt, (for the ordinary matter) and ſhalt be damned. <hi>Saul</hi> yeeldeth God imperfect obedience, he obeyeth the command in part, he fighteth againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> ſlayeth the people and the cattell, and yet notwithſtanding
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114897:64"/>caſt out of his Kingdome, and kept from Heaven for ever. <hi>David</hi> committeth a greater ſinne for the matter of it, he committeth adultery, murthereth <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> lieth in the ſinne almoſt a twelve-month, and yet he is pardoned. What is the reaſon: <hi>Saul</hi> was under the Law, therefore no acceptance without perfect obedience. <hi>David</hi> indeed for the matter of his ſinne did worſe, but <hi>David</hi> was under grace; there is no ſinne ſo great but he had a pardon for it, the leaſt obedience, ſo in truth, was accepted. Oh remember this, you are ready to beare out your ſelves with this conceit, becauſe <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and other Saints ſinned ſo, and are pardoned, therefore you may ſinne ſo, and be pardoned. Indeed it is true, you ſhall be pardoned if you are in Chriſt, and are under grace: but yet being unconverted, thou art therefore in the ſtate of nature, and ſo under the Law, and not under grace. Here is the third Uſe.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt is for Exhortation, to exhort you all, that you would indeavour, and be perſwaded to get an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, ſeeing there is ſo much priviledge comming to thoſe that are in Chriſt. Whoſoever is in Chriſt, is <hi>not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> as therefore thou deſireſt not to be under the Law, ſo labour thou to be found in Chriſt; above all things ſtudy this, how to get a part in him.</p>
                  <p>My brethren; The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is amongſt you, he is daily offred to you; oh doe but receive him, and you ſhall receive this priviledge, to be under grace, and not under the Law.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there are a great many hard things to be done of them that will have a part in Chriſt, they muſt deny themſelves, they muſt take up the Croſſe and follow him; there is a great many things to be loſt, they muſt loſe the love of all their carnall friends, their ſinfull liberties, the applauſe and favour of the world: yet notwithſtanding all theſe difficulties, be you perſwaded to entertaine Chriſt whatſoever it coſt you; for if you will entertain Chriſt you ſhall come to be in this ſtate, not to be <hi>under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Therefore when God calleth you, inviteth you, and offereth his Sonne
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114897:64"/>unto you, oh in brace him, <hi>Open your everlaſting doores, and let the King of glory come in:</hi> When Chriſt is tendered upon theſe conditions, that you receive him to be your King, your Prieſt, and Prophet, that you kiſſe that Son of God, and give up your ſelves in all things unto him to let him reign over you, oh doe it, for by this you ſhall come to have this priviledge, that you ſhall <hi>not be under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> And what then ſhall hurt you? No ſinne, all ſhall be pardoned. No defect, all ſhall be covered: No want of obedience, the leaſt ſhall be accepted. What can a poor ſoule deſire more? Therefore when ever Chriſt is offered to you, joyn your ſoules to him, that you may be in that condition, <hi>not to be under the Law, but under Gree.</hi> Thus much for the ground and reaſon of the former promiſe, why <hi>ſinne ſhould not have domision over them,</hi> becauſe they <hi>are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> And ſo much for this time, and this Text.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Wiſeman had diſcovered the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the adulterous woman in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter: In this he bringeth in Wiſdome as a holy and chaſt matron, propounding ſeaſonable and comfortable counſell to all the ſinfull ſons of men. And in this ſpeech of Wiſedom, there are two parts or paſſages: Firſt, the Sermon it ſelf, from the beginning of the Chapter to the words now read: Secondly, the application thereof, from this verſe to the end of the Chapter, whereby wiſdome laboureth to work the ſouls of thoſe, to whom ſhe had delivered the former truth, and commended her ſelf by many forcible arguments, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of her bleſſed counſell: <hi>Now therefore,</hi> ſaith ſhee, <hi>hearken unto me;</hi> As if ſhe ſhould ſay, If this be true that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath been delivered to you, that happineſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, grace and glory, are propounded unto, and ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them that hearken and give attention to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114897:67"/>words of wiſdome: What now remaineth, but that forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all other courſes, both the deviſes and deluſions of the adulterous woman, and all the beguiling inticements of the world and Satan, you come cheerfully, and hearken attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the counſell that is propounded to you, and you ſhall not doe this in vain, you ſhall not labour for no benefit; but thoſe that ſo hear as to <hi>keep my Waies,</hi> ſhall not onely be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to me, but receive a bleſſedneſs from me; <hi>for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that keep my waies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words themſelves there are two paſſages to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Firſt the duty that Wiſdome calleth for; <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hearken unto me, O yee children:</hi> Secondly the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby ſhee laboureth to draw the hearts of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom ſhe ſpeaketh, to give entertainment to that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, <hi>for bleſſed are they that keep my waies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the duty it ſelf, you have firſt the parties ſpoken to, <hi>Children.</hi> Secondly, the dutie that muſt be performed by theſe children. hearkning; <hi>Hearken.</hi> Thirdly, the partie that they muſt hearken unto, <hi>to mee,</hi> to Wiſdome. Laſtly, the ſtrength or force of reaſon from whence all this followeth, implied in the firſt words, <hi>Now therefore;</hi> conſidering what counſell hath been adminiſtred to you, conſidering all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varall reaſons propounded to perſwade you, <hi>Now therefore, hearken unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe, The Parties to whom Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſpeaks, I ſhall not ſay any thing, becauſe I would haſten to that I moſt principally intend, being unwilling to be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or hold you over long. Let us come therefore to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing, the dutie that is required, and that is hearkning; and we will joyn with this for the quicker diſpatch, the third paſſage in the Text; the Partie to whom they muſt hearken, <hi>unto me; Hearken unto me.</hi> And firſt, let me ſhew you what is to be underſtood here by <hi>hearkning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>hearkning,</hi> briefly you muſt underſtand theſe ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. The firſt is, a hearing with the ear. The ſecond is, a cloſing with the truth, by the underſtanding of that we hear, for look as the ear receiveth the ſound, ſo the mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114897:67"/>muſt apprehend the ſenſe, and aſſent to the truth of what is delivered. Thirdly, the memorie muſt retain and hold, that which the underſtanding hath received. The laſt and principall thing is, the ſtooping of the ſoul, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, to that which is underſtood and remembred. For then indeed according to the Phraſe of the Spirit of God in Scripture, a man is ſaid to hearken, when the ſoul begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to yeeld and ſubject it ſelf, and to take the impreſſion of that truth, which God is pleaſed to make known unto it, and that is the meaning of the Phraſe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.15. The Text ſaith there of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> that when the ancient men came to counſell him, <hi>he hearkned not unto them;</hi> as if it ſhould be ſaid, he heard them well enough, and he underſtood them well enough, and he retained their counſel in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well enough, but his ſoul yeelded not to it, his heart im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced not that counſel, he did not ſubject himſelf thereunto, therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>He hearkned not to the counſell of the old men.</hi> The like Phraſe we have touching the ſons of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25 When their father ſpake to them after a cold faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Text ſaith, <hi>They hearkned not unto the voice of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> They heard his words well enough, and underſtood what he ſaid, but their ſouls ſtooped not, their hearts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not, they did not ſubject themſelves, to take in the impreſſion of the truth upon them, and to be framed to the wiſdome of God revealed to them in the ſame. So that, my brethren, then a man is ſaid to hearken, when his ear heareth the ſound, his underſtanding cloſeth with the ſenſe, and his memorie retains it, and his heart cometh under it, ſtoopeth to it, yeelds up it ſelf to the impreſſion of the truths delivered, to be diſpoſed of thereafter. In brief therefore this is the meaning: A carefull attention to the word, that includes the three former; and obedience and ſubjection of heart to the word thus attended to, comprized in the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Now for the party to be hearkned unto, that is, <hi>unto me.</hi> What is meant here by the word <hi>mee?</hi> If you have recourſe to the beginning of this Chapter, you ſhall ſee it is Wiſdom:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114897:68"/>And by Wiſdom here you are to underſtand the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo far as he hath pleaſed to reveal himſelf to us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Word of God, or work of his grace. For Chriſt is here eſpecially meant, but not Chriſt meerly or barely as God, nor Chriſt in the ſecond perſon; but ſo far as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the wiſdome of his Father, is pleaſed by the work of his grace, by the power of his Spirit, in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the word, either written or preached, to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us. So far he is ſaid to be Wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>The words now are clear; you ſee what is to be underſtood by <hi>hearkning,</hi> and who the par<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ie is to whom we muſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The Point then that ariſeth from theſe two parts of the Text, thus joyned together in the Explication, is evident, and it is to this effect, Namely, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The voice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ought onely to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, and muſt be obeyed of all his faithfull ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, <hi>Of all his faithfull ſervants.</hi> The Lord Chriſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> vain to ſpeak to others; therefore he addreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely to his children. Theſe are they that muſt attend and obey his voice, whatſoever he ſhall be pleaſed to reveal unto them, they muſt ſubmit themſelves unto it, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and above all others in the world.</p>
                  <p>The Point is clear and evident. You ſee it is the main purpoſe and intent of Chriſt in this place, and therefore hee calleth for audience, he deſireth to gain acceptance at the hands of men: As if he ſhould ſay in other terms, Lay by all other advice, onely hearken unto me my children; let cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt counſell, carnall advice, the ſinfull deluſions of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſons in the world, let them all paſſe, onely hear and hearken unto me, entertain and unbrace my counſell, ſubmit your hearts to my inſtructions. And not onely Chriſt requires this of his children in this place, under the name of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but it is the injunction of God himſelf, and that from heaven; it is ſuch a truth, and of ſo great importance, that God himſelf from heaven makes it known, and giveth it in ſpeciall charge to all the ſons of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. When
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114897:68"/>Chriſt was transfigured in the Mount, <hi>There came a voice out of the cloud,</hi> which ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved ſon in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi> Mark, <hi>there came a voice out of the cloud;</hi> It is not onely the voice of man that perſwades you, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d enjoyns you to give audience to the Lord Jeſus, but God himſelf, and that from heaven, and that in mediately with his own mouth, layeth this upon us as a dutie that we are to perform, that we ſhould hear his Son, that is, hear him above all, more then all, nay, hear him onely, and none but him. It is that alſo which Chriſt himſelf calleth for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, There are many maſters and teachers in the world, but leave all the reſt, and come hither, and <hi>learn of me, for I am</hi> &amp;c. Yea, it is not onely the charge of God, and command of Chriſt, but it hath been, and is the generall reſolution of the Saints of God from day to day. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.2. all the people joyned hand in hand as it were, <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his waies, and we will walk in his paths: for the Law ſhall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> As if they ſhould have ſaid, Becauſe from Zion cometh the Law, becauſe at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the word of God is taught and revealed, therefore it is high time for us to go thither; come let us goe, let us wait upon God there, <hi>he will teach us of his waies,</hi> and what remaineth? <hi>we will walk in his paths,</hi> we will ſtoop unto the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, we will ſubmit our ſelves to it, and conform our hearts and lives to the will of God revealed to us from thence. And you ſhall obſerve the holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> as though there had been no Temple, no Prieſt, no Teacher beſides, how his good ſoul is ſtill breathing upward in many paſſages of the 119. <hi>Pſalm, Lord teach me, Lord quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee, Lord give underſtanding to thy ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> He repaireth ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nly and chiefly to the Lord for guidance and direction. Enough for the proof of the point.</p>
                  <p>But a man may aske, after what manner muſt I hearken? Hearkning I told you implyeth attention and obedience,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114897:69"/>therefore you may remember, that I put them both together in the Doctrine, that it was our duty, both to attend to the voice of Chriſt, and to yeeld obedience unto it. But how muſt I doe this? For the opening hereof give me leave to diſcover unto you three particulars, which are ſpecially to be conſidered, and are required of every ſoule that would make conſcience of diſcharging this duty.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, we are then ſaid to hearken to the voice of Chriſt as we ſhould doe, when we firſt ſeek to him, and depend wholly and onely upon him for direction. I doe not ſay, but we may uſe all good meanes and helpes that God ſhall pleaſe to put in our hands: But this I ſay, howſoever we may uſe other meanes, yet we muſt depend upon no other but the Lord Jeſus: firſt of all have recourſe unto him, and withall reſolve, that he onely ſhall caſt the ſcale, that his direction ſhall onely ſtand with us, in whatſoever caſe it is we deſire counſell. And then the ſoule is ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to depend upon Chriſt for direction, when it doth acknowledge a kind of ſoveraignty in him, and alſo an all-ſufficiency to direct a man: ſo that howſoever we ſometimes heare the counſell of others, and hearken to the voyce of the Miniſter and of private friends, yet we ever uſe them, but as means to bring us to Chriſt, and to reveale his counſell unto us: and there being diverſity of opinions, and variety of judgements in many matters of Religion, and that amongſt godly and learned men, yet in all points, that which mainly caſteth the ſcales with us, is not the learning or holineſſe of this, or that man, but the ſo veraignty and authority of Chriſt, what he ſaith, what his mind and his judgement is, and what he would have us to doe, This is the depending of the ſoule upon Chriſt. You ſhall obſerve in the Old Teſtament, how this courſe was ever taken up by the Saints in any matter of difficulty, how they had alwayes recourſe to the counſell of God, and made their repair to his mouth. We may read how often <hi>David</hi> did this, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. When the matter was in much queſtion, and he in a great ſtraight, and every one gave in their ſeverall opinions, he went and enquired of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114897:69"/>Lord, ſaying, <hi>Shall I goe and ſmite theſe</hi> Philiſtines? <hi>verſe</hi> 2. And when the Lord bad him goe, and his followers were utterly againſt it, he enquired yet again, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. and in the concluſion the counſell of the Lord bore the ſway with him, though in the judgement of fleſh and blood it ſeemed the worſe. So again, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>Will the men of</hi> Keilah <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me up into the hands of</hi> Saul? <hi>will</hi> Saul <hi>come down?</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. when he had long pleaded with God, as it were, in the time of Extremity, ſee whither he had recourſe at the laſt, and upon what he ſetled himſelfe: <hi>verſe</hi> 8. he reſolveth upon this, <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak;</hi> that is, I will not eye meanes, nor look upon any mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but I will hear what the Lord will ſay. My brethren, this is the courſe that every one of us muſt take, if ever we purpoſe to hearken to the Lord in a right manner; we muſt upon all occaſions, in all doubts and queſtions, have recourſe to him, and labour to captivate our judgements to that truth, that ſhall be delivered to us from him, as knowing all other directions are good, onely ſo farre as they are ſquared by that ſtandard. Look as men doe in their Law matter; If one have a ſute depending in an inferiour Court, and cannot meet with ſatisfaction there, according to the ſtate of his cauſe, he appealeth to a higher Court, and there ſtandeth at the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the cheif Judge: ſo ought it to be with us in all ſpirituall doubts and difficulties; we muſt appeale from the conceits and counſels of men to the authority of Chriſt. This is a point that is groſly miſtaken, and the contrary profeſſed, and maintained in popery: But I ſhall not meddle with that at this time.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt rule, ſo to repair to Chriſt, as wholly to depend upon him for direction. But marke this; we muſt repaire to him in the firſt place, and not ſuffer our judgement to be foreſtalled with former counſels; but firſt, while the minde lyeth equally and indifferently diſpoſed, then ſet the word ſtep in, then let us repaire to Chriſt for guidance in the cauſe. The contrary is a great hinderance to the effectuall paſſage of the Word of God into the hearts and ſoules of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114897:70"/>men, and the world may eaſily obſerve it. For look what points men have drunk in, or what cuſtomes they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, they keep and retain them, and there is no ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them; their hearts are foreſtalled againſt the truth, and poſſeſt with other principles or carnall cuſtomes, and therefore the word of God takes no place in them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing, we are to take notice of, concerning the manner of our hearkning to the voyce of Chriſt, is this; As the ſoule muſt firſt ſeek unto Chriſt, and depend upon him for direction, ſo in the next place, the heart muſt ſettle it ſelfe upon the truth revealed, and quiet it ſelfe in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of that direction, that God hath been pleaſed to make known unto it. We muſt not liſten and hearken to any of thoſe deluſions and ſilly deviſes, wherewith Satan, by the miniſtery of his inſtruments, laboureth to draw us from the truth; but our minds being enlightned, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell of God being made known unto us, we ought to take up our reſt and ſtanding there, ſettle there; let heaven and earth move, but ſtirre not a foot from that truth God hath made known to us. It was great folly in that good Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. to doe otherwiſe, and he ſuffered for it. He was ſent on a meſſage againſt <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and was charged by the Word of the Lord; nor to eat bread, nor drinke water in that place, nor turn again by the ſame way that he came: and accordingly he refuſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers offers, and withſtood ſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dry perſwaſions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But at length there came an old Prophet to him, as ſubtill as ancient, and he takes upon him to perſwade him to return back to eat, and drink, and to refreſh himſelfe: and he pleadeth; <hi>I am a Prophet as well as thou, and an Angell ſpake unto me by the word of the Lord,</hi> and charged me to reveal to thee, that thou ſhouldſt come home with me, though with no body elſe? Hereupon the young Prophet yeelded to him, and went back with him, and eat bread in his houſe, and drank water: wherefore the Lord flew him. My brethren take heed of this: The Prophet had a plain charge, the will of the Lord was openly revealed to him; he gave
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114897:70"/>him an expreſs command to denounce the ſentence againſt <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and that he ſhould not ſtay to eat or drink in that place; when the word of the Lord is ſo clear, if an Angell from heaven ſhould come and teach otherwiſe, <hi>let him be accurſed,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. So in ought to be with every Chriſtian: when once the truth is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us, and our mindes truly inlightned with the knowledge of Gods will; we muſt reſolve not to hearken to any perſwaſions to the contrary, though they be backed with never ſo many ſhews of Religion or learning.</p>
                  <p>But a queſtion here may be demanded; ſhall not a man be willing to heare better counſell happily then his own? Muſt he heare nothing at all againſt ſuch an opinion, or practiſe, as he conceives to be grounded upon divine truth, and which he hath been taught by thoſe teachers he hath depended upon? Who knoweth not that a man may eaſily be deceived, and miſtake the ſenſe of Gods Spirit in the word; ſo as to imbrace errour inſtead of truth?</p>
                  <p>My brethren, by the cunning ſubtilty of the enemy, this conceit hath crept into the mind of all Heretiques, that look what they once drink in, they muſt ever retain it as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and never think of removing, or unſetling from it. This is an hook, whereby the Devill holdeth multitudes of men in falſehood and errour, and in wicked courſes, They will heare nothing againſt that which formerly they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and been perſwaded unto by thoſe they depend upon. This policie the Devill uſeth in Popery, and amongſt the <hi>Familiſts,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> teaching them to reſolve to hold whatſoever they have received, either from themſelves or others. And here, I ſay, it is ſinfull for a man to reſolve to heare no counſell at all againſt his opinion. But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, this I ſay; When a man is perſwaded, that the opinion, or courſe he takes up is ſuch, as God himſelfe hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make known unto him out of his Word; he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing againſt this, but meerly out of the Word: let nothing unſettle our judgement in a plain and revealed truth, but onely hold to that: As I have been ſettled by the truth,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114897:71"/>ſo if ever I change my opinion, the truth is that which ſhall reform me; all the counſell I take up, and all the opinions I hold, ſhall be ſuch as the Word of God ſhall reveal to mee. And becauſe my minde may be weak, and my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frail, and not able to ſee the ſenſe of the ſpirit, therefore I will hear nothing againſt a good courſe, but onely out of the Word. If my opinion and my courſe be ſuch as I am perſwaded is the truth revealed out of the word, howſoever I may be deluded, yet this I will attribute to the Word of God; no opinion, no authoritie of any other ſhall carry the truth from me; but the word ſhall reform me, as the word hath perſwadad me, and as the word hath revealed to me. This you ſhall obſerve to be the counſell of God in ſeverall places of Scripture: Mark what the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 1.27. he deſireth this at their hands, that they would <hi>ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one minde,</hi> in the truth revealed; and to the <hi>Coloſſians, Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Continue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the faith, grounded and ſetled, and be not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved away from the hope of the Goſpel, which you have heard, and which was preached unto you:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, If you have received that ſatisfaction from the word of God, that you are convinced that it is the word of God, and that the courſe you take is grounded upon it, be not moved, but ſtand faſt in that truth received. This is the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt thing, which concerneth the manner of our hearkning to the voice of Chriſt, is this: When thus the ſoul is perſwaded of the will of God revealed, and when the heart ſetleth it ſelf upon it, and hears nothing againſt the good pleaſure of the Lord thus manifeſted, then in the laſt place the ſoul muſt yeeld obedience therunto, not alone in doing the thing God commandeth, but in doing the will of God in ſo doing. Mark, not alone, I ſay, performing what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us, but to be carried to the performance of the dutie meerly becauſe God requireth it. For theſe you muſt obſerve are two diſtinct things and of great difference. A man may doe the thing which God commandeth, and yet notwithſtanding never doe Gods will but his own. Many
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114897:71"/>a man cometh to Church and there hears, and underſtands, and remembers, and doth the things that God would have him doe, and yet in the mean time doth not at all the will of God; for he doth not therefore go to Church becauſe God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, but partly either becauſe cuſtome, or ſhame, or the Law, or ſomewhat elſe forceth him to it. Here therefore is the main pitch of our obedience, not alone to perform what is the good pleaſure of God, but to let the will of God be the firſt mover of our ſouls, in the diſcharging of that ſervice he calleth for at our hands, to doe what we doe, becauſe it is the will of God we ſhould doe it; to perform what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in obedience to him, becauſe he requires it. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt putteth theſe together in his prayer to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. <hi>If thou be willing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>remove this Cup from me, nevertheleſs, not my will, but thine be done.</hi> He ſaith not that he will do the thing that God requireth, but he will doe the will of God in it, the will of God ſhould be the carrier and mover of him to take upon him the great work of redemption. So ſhould it be with us in every thing we doe: It is not my will that moveth me, but the will of God; it is not my pleaſure that provokes me to this ſervice, but the pleaſure of God. This is the third thing requiſite in our manner of hearkning to the voice of Chriſt. And this may be ſufficient for the explication of the point.</p>
                  <p>Onely let me adde one thing more: Hence it followeth clearly, That he that doth the will of God, becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, will obey all the good pleaſure of the Lord: Hee will obey him in every thing, as well as in one thing, in the hardeſt command, as well as in that which is more eaſie, in that which moſt croſſeth his nature, as well as in that which is more ſuteable thereunto. This indeed is that which makes a Chriſtian conſtant in his walking with God, notwithſtanding all thoſe difficulties and diſcouragements he meets withall; when as others are fain to baulk many things which are required of them to perform. For (my brethren) if a man onely take up the practiſe of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Religion, as ſute with his own humour, or eaſe, or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114897:72"/>profit, or the like; when thoſe fail, his performance of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> faileth alſo: if there be no other motive to carrie him along in the ſervice of God, but theſe outward and carnall conſiderations, when they are gone, his ſervice of God is gone alſo: And therefore we find by experience, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men can be content to give us the hearing, they will come to Church, and attend to the word of God; but they will take up no more, they will be tyed to the performance of no dutie, further then it ſtandeth with their own oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and ſuteth with their own ſinfull diſpoſitions. But now hee that is carried along in all his ſervices by the will of God, if that be the principall mover of him in all his performances; then when ever that will is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, let it bee what it will bee, let it croſſe him never ſo much, or be never ſo contrary to his diſpoſition, yet he is the ſame in every thing, that he is in one thing. This is that which is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. <hi>For Moſes truly ſaid unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all things whatſoever hee ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> Mark, <hi>him ſhall you hear in all things;</hi> that is, Whatſoever he ſhall make known unto you to bee the will of God, to that you ſhall yeeld obedience. And this is a neceſſary conſequent of the former: For if the will of God be the firſt mover of the ſoul to every performance, then being at any time revealed, it caſteth the ballance, and commands the ſoul willingly to yeeld to what God requireth in every thing.</p>
                  <p>Thus much ſhall ſerve for the clearing of the Point. The ſubſtance of all that I have ſaid is thus much, namely, That the voice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt be ſo alone hearkned to and obeyed, that firſt of all we muſt ſeek to him, and depend onely and wholly upon him for direction: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we muſt ſettle our hearts and judgements upon that truth that is by him revealed unto us: And laſtly, that wee muſt be moved to the performance of every dutie, becauſe God requires it; and conſequently, that our obedience bee univerſall, that <hi>we hear him in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:114897:72"/>
                  <p>Now a Queſtion may be here propounded, How ſhall a man hear the voice of Chriſt? Indeed (happily may a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man ſay) if the Lord Chriſt would reveal himſelf to us immediately, and his word were made known to us by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we would preſently yeeld obedience thereunto without any contradiction. How ſhall a man therefore know when the voice of Chriſt is made known?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer briefly, the voice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is made known to us two waies: Firſt, the word of God in the Scripture ever hath the voice of Chriſt in it: Whatſoever the word ſpeaks, the Lord himſelf ſpeaks. The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. ſaith, that unto the Jewes <hi>were committed the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God.</hi> What were thoſe Oracles of God? Nothing but the Scriptures. So that this everlaſting truth, this word of God rightly underſtood, and truly conceived, alwaies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the voice of Jeſus Chriſt with it. And therefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the Scriptures in generall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. ſaith, that thoſe <hi>holy men of God,</hi> that were the Penmen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>ſpake as they were moved</hi> or inſpired by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> thereby intimating unto us, that the Scriptures are the very inſpirations of God, the very breath (as one may ſay) of the the Holy Ghoſt: So that look whatſoever it is that the Scriptures make known to us, God from heaven hath ſpoken it, even as truly, and as really, as though he had ſpoken it immediately; What the word ſaith, God himſelf ſaith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whatſoever any faithfull Miniſter ſhall ſpeak out of the Word, that is alſo the voice of Chriſt. The Texts are many that are to this purpoſe: Give me leave to touch but one or two of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.3. <hi>Ye ſeek a proof,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>of Chriſt ſpeaking in me, which to you-wards is not weak, but is mightie in you:</hi> Implying, that whatſoever is ſpoken out of the word of God, what truth ſoever is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us by the mouth of his Miniſters, agreeable to the word, Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks in them. Therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is plain, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114897:73"/>me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> That which the Miniſters of God ſpeak, the God of Heaven himſelfe ſpeakes: and they that deſpiſe their miniſtry, the God of Heaven will require it, even as if he himſelfe ſhould ſpeak from Heaven, and men ſhould reject his words. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that the Lord Jeſus, by the power of his Spirit, went and preached in the time of <hi>Noah</hi> to the Spirits that are now in Hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.29. to thoſe people that were diſobedient before the floud, to whom <hi>Noah</hi> preached partly by his practiſe, and partly by his directions, Chriſt himſelfe ſpake, even by that Spirit whereby he quickneth all things. So then the point is evident.</p>
                  <p>But what reaſon is there, that a man ſhould ſtoop to the voyce and command of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>In a word, firſt, He that alone hath command over us, and right to require ſervice at our hands, him onely we ought to obey: Now Chriſt alone is our Lord, and we are his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>Eli</hi> joyneth theſe together in his direction to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth.</hi> If Chriſt alone therefore be our Lord, whom elſe ſhould we hear? unto whom elſe ſhould we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and yeeld obedience?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The direction of Chriſt is the ſureſt and ſafeſt: look what counſell the Lord Jeſus giveth, we may build upon it. As for others, ſome are ignorant, and know not how to teach; ſome negligent and idle, and will not teach; ſome corrupt in their judgement, and may infect us: But Chriſt, being Knowledge it ſelfe, and Truth it ſelfe, neither can, nor will deceive us: Therefore whatſoever the Lord Chriſt ſhall make known, we may reſt upon it; and whatſoever courſe we take up upon his directions, we may undoubtedly perſwade our ſelvts, that it ſhall goe well with us in the iſſue. Our Saviour joyneth the ſame reaſon to his exhortation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart:</hi> What then? <hi>And yee ſhall find reſt unto your ſoules:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, The counſels and directions that men give, they doe not, they will not, they cannot give a man
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114897:73"/>any reſt: but the counſell that I give, and thoſe directions that I reveale unto you out of my word, what ever ſoule imbraceth them, what ever heart entertaineth them, ſhall find reſt and comfort to it ſelfe for ever. Let us perſwade our ſelves, that whatſoever the Lord ſpeakes will not ſaile us; there is none that truſts upon him, that even ſhall be aſhamed: his counſell is ſeaſonable, and will be profitable to us, if it be bleſſed of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt onely is able to teach us: Man may teach the care, but the Lord onely can frame the ſoule, and bring the heart to obedience. That place, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32.45. is worth the remembring: Verſe 32. it is ſaid, that the Lord <hi>opened to the Diſciples the Scriptures;</hi> and Verſe 45. that <hi>he opened their underſtanding, that they might underſtand the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> Men can onely reveale truths to us; but never a man in the world is able to perſwade our hearts, and put underſtanding into our mindes: but the Lord not onely openeth the ſenſe and meaning of the Scriptures, but he giveth us mindes to know, and hearts to imbrace what we ought to doe. Now let us gather theſe up together: The Lord onely hath right to command us, therefore we ought to obey him; His rules and directions are ſuch as are moſt ſure and ſafe, therefore moſt worthy to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, He onely can teach the inward man; men may teach the care, but have no power to bow the ſoule, to buckle the heart, <hi>to give wiſdome and underſtanding to the ſimple,</hi> onely the Lord that dwelleth in heaven is he that muſt doe it. Let us now ſee what Uſe we may make of this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is as it were a bill of Inditement, falling marvellouſly heavy upon the practiſe of many that live in the boſome of the Church: thoſe I mean, that will heare any thing, attend to any thing, but to the voyce of Chriſt. Whom they ſhould heare, they neglect; and thoſe they ought to neglect, they will heare, whether the Lord will or no: The Drunkard hearkeneth to his companions; they no ſooner ſay, as thoſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Caſt in thy lot among us, let us all have one
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114897:74"/>purſe;</hi> or (as the ſpeech of our good fellowes is) Comes let us goe and club it; but preſently he gives his conſent. The Adulterer ſtoopeth to the glance of the Adultereſſe, and that prevaileth with him, <hi>he goeth after her ſtraightways as an Oxe goeth to the ſlaughter, or as a Foole to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſtocks, Prov.</hi> 7.22. The truth is, if you mark the ordinary and common courſe of the wicked and ungodly men of the world, you may eaſily ſee how every thing is imbraced, onely the voice of Chriſt is refuſed. Nay, though Satan whiſper not, though occaſions move not, yet mark how the ſoule of ſuch men yeeldeth to the inclinations of every ſinfull luſt. If a luſtfull thought ariſe in the heart, ſee how the ſoule ſucks the ſweetneſſe of it by meditation, how it is delighted in the contemplation of filthyneſſe: If a covetous thought, oh how the man purſueth it, he will never be at quiet till he have hatched ſome ſinfull reſolution within, and brought forth ſome ungodly practiſe abroad. It is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſee in that one place. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. how the voyce of gain ſounded ſo loud in the eares of thoſe covetous Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, that the voyce of <hi>Paul</hi> could not be heard. Doe but obſerve how <hi>Demetrius</hi> reaſoneth the caſe with his follow-crafteſmen, Verſe 25. <hi>Sirs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you know that by this craft we have our wealth,</hi> we get our living; <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, you ſee and hear, that not alone at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>but almoſt throughout all</hi> Aſia, <hi>this</hi> Paul <hi>hath perſwaded and turned away much people,</hi> from entertaining and following this ſuperſtitious courſe, <hi>ſaying, that they be no gods which are made with hands: So that this our craft is in danger to be ſet at nought. When they heard theſe ſayings,</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>all men with one voyce cryed out about the ſpace of two houres, Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians. Truly ſo it is now in the world; there is ſuch a noyſe in mens mindes and judgements, what the World will have, and what Profit will have, and what Pleaſure will have, that the Lord Chriſt may call till he be hoarſe, and yet no man will mind him, but all <hi>ſtop their cares, and refuſe to heare the voyce of the Charmer, charme he never ſo wiſely, Pſal,</hi> 58.4, 5. It is evident then, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114897:74"/>theſe men are not the Schollers o Chriſt, and certainly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement of Chriſt ſhall be executed upon them hereafter. In the mean time let me wiſh ſuch to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that place, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. When men will not <hi>receive the truth in the love of it, but have pleaſure in ungodlineſs;</hi> when they ſhut out the truth, and will not be perſwaded to forſake their ungodly courſes, but ſuffer their ſins, and ſinfull occaſions to prevail with them above the word of God, what befalleth them? See what the Text ſaith, and the Lord faſten it upon your hearts: Read it over and over again, <hi>That they all might be damned who beleeved not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Mark, I beſeech you, this is the word of God; Who ever he is that hath pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe, and will not hear and receive the truth in the love thereof, ſo as to yeeld obedience thereunto, and to frame his courſe according to it, God hath appointed that man to everlaſting damnation. So that when thy conſcience calleth thee to the diſcharge of ſuch and ſuch duties, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſuch and ſuch courſes, and the word of God ſhineth full in thy face, and is as clear to thee as the Sun at noon-day; when the Lord hath revealed to thee his will, and yet thy ſoul can ſay within thee, notwithſtanding all this, Thou haſt loved thoſe ſins which God out of his word hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thee, thou haſt had pleaſure in thoſe courſes which God in his word hath condemned, thoſe proud and adulterous courſes, thoſe ungodly practiſes; thou haſt harboured them in thy heart, and kept them in thy boſome, and taken pleaſure in the practiſe of them: Doth thy own ſoul ſay this? Well then my brethren, make the concluſion your ſelves: See I beſeech you, doth not the Word of God ſay plainly, that the Lord hath ſealed ſuch up to everlaſting damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe?</p>
                  <p>A Second ſort that are here juſtly to be reproved, are thoſe that captivate their own opinions and conceits to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men. There are a poor kind of deluded creatures in the world, that have made themſelves ſo far ſervants unto men, that they have pinned their conceits and judgements to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114897:75"/>the opinions and commands of thoſe upon whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and from whom they expect either profit or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That look what their great maſters ſay, whatſoever they ſpeak, that they account as Goſpel; and whatſoever theſe have deviſed, they muſt deſend and maintain it, and their judgements muſt entertain nothing to the contrary. Theſe are marvellouſly eſtranged from the Lord, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this truth that hath been taught from the words of this Text. For doth not the Text ſay, <hi>Hearken unto me?</hi> Therefore it plainly reproveth thoſe that can be content to have the word of men to carry weight with them, and the commands of men to caſt the ballance; that whatſoever they will have practiſed muſt be yeelded unto, let the word of Chriſt ſay what it will; and they muſt be content to give up themſelves to perform it, let it be agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or not. This argueth clearly that theſe are the ſervants of men, and that they have <hi>mens perſons in admiration for filthy lucres ſake,</hi> becauſe they thinke that their profit, or pleaſure, or preferment is gone, if their good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be not obſerved upon whom they depend. This is an ordinary and groſſe fault: The wife ſhe complaineth, and ſaith, Indeed it is true, the courſe is good that you wiſh me to, and I am perſwaded that God requireth it, but my husband is againſt it, and I ſhall loſe the love and reſpect, that I have alwaies had from him, if now I enter upon ſuch a courſe. The husband he complaineth, and ſaith, A holy converſation is good, and ſuch duties as you call upon me to exerciſe in my family, cannot but be pleaſing unto God, and ſuch as he requires; but if I ſhould take up ſuch a practice, my wife would be continually beſieging me with daily vexations, I ſhould neglect my calling, and incur the cenſure of my neighbours and friends, and bee counted too too preciſe. Theſe and many others that I could inſtance in, are not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place there come in alſo another ſort to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and theſe are ſuch as can be content to give the Lord the hearing, but will doc nothing when it ſhould come
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114897:75"/>to performance. Howſoever happily they will approve and applaud that which the Miniſter delivers to them from God, yet in the concluſion, if their eaſe, and honours, and liberties lie at hazard, they fail in matter of practiſe; they will doc nothing, they dare doc nothing further then they are adviſed unto by thoſe Counſellors that keep a kinde of audit in their hearts; and what ſentence they deliver ſhall be yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and no more.</p>
                  <p>To inſtance a little: The world knoweth that it is the will of God that every man ſhould <hi>deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe, and follow Chriſt,</hi> that a man ſhould <hi>hate father and mother, and wife, and children, and friends, and all, for his ſake, and the Goſpels,</hi> that a man ſhould renounce all thoſe courſes of ſin that carry with them the moſt appearance of profit and pleaſure, that he ſhould <hi>pluck out his right eie,</hi> and <hi>cut off his right hand:</hi> Theſe are truths that are clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Word of God, and every ſoul that is rightly informed yeelds unto them; and men in the world are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, hearing them preſſed from day to day in the preaching of the Word: And ſo alſo that it is the will of God that men ſhould <hi>be pure as God is pure,</hi> and <hi>be holy as he is holy in all manner of converſation;</hi> that they ſhould <hi>abſtain from all appearance of evill:</hi> this the Lord requireth, and this men commend and approve of. But now come to matter of practiſe: If a dutie be required that will croſſe their eaſe, or their honours, or in the leaſt meaſure diminiſh their outward comforts: Mark what followeth, then they are at ademurr; they will ſtay there, and thinke twice of it before they will doe any thing; they muſt firſt take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and be well adviſed of it. And what counſell doc they take? Not from the Lord and his word, but from their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and profits, and carnall delights and contentments. The ambitious man asketh his honour, Shall I be ſincere and zealous in the cauſe of God? The covetous man asketh his wealth, Shall I be exact in a Chriſtian courſe? Shall I loſe this gain or that advantage, for the keeping of a good conſcience? The voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man asketh his pleaſure, Shall I <hi>abſtain from the appearance
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114897:76"/>of evil?</hi> Shall I <hi>hate the garment ſpotted with the fleſh?</hi> Shall I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the way that is called holy, and walk therein with that preciſeneſs and ſtrictneſs that the word of God requires? Then they all cry unto a man, as ſometime <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto Chriſt, when he had told his Diſciples, That he muſt ſuffer many things of the Elders and Scribes and be killed, <hi>Be it far from thee, Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee, Matth.</hi> 16.22. and they hang about him, as once <hi>Pauls</hi> friends hung about him, when they heard that he muſt be bound at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 20.37, 38. and 21.12. No, ſaith honour, if once you take that courſe, then I muſt be abaſed: No, ſaith profit, if once you walk that way, I muſt be neglected: No, ſaith pleaſure, if you mean to walk ſo ſtrictly and exactly before God and men, then abandon all pleaſure, you and I muſt bid farewell for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Now the poor ſoul returneth this anſwer to God, and to his Word and Miniſter; I have taken counſell concerning that which you require of me, and am adviſed to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; my pleaſure, and my profit, and my preferment tell me, that it will be marvellous tedious, irkſome, and grievous to take ſuch courſes. I find this way every where ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and therefore conceive it better to lie quietly, and ſleep in a whole skin, then to bring an old houſe upon my head.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what the pleas of carnall men are. To all which I ſay but one thing: Let them ask their own hearts but this one queſtion: Is this to hear the voice of Chriſt, or not? If it be not (as moſt certain it is not) then the caſe is clear: He that doth not hear the voice of Chriſt, is none of Chriſts. It is our Saviours own concluſion, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. <hi>Hee that is of God, heareth Gods words; yee therefore hear them not, becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> That is, Whoſoever they be that will hear any counſell but the counſell of God, that will bee content to be ruled by any thing rather then by his word, God will not own them hereafter, they are none of his, that is, they have no work of grace in them; for ſo the Apoſtle expounds it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>All things are of God,</hi> that is, God is the worker and framer of ſaving grace in the ſoul of his ſervants. He therefore that will not ſtoop and be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114897:76"/>to the voice of Chriſt, hath no ſaving grace as yet wrought in his heart, and conſequently is not of God. This me thinks ſhould awaken the ſouls of all ſuch poor carnall creatures, as love their pleaſures, and profits, and preferments more then God: I beſeech you think of it, and know it for a certain, that while you hear theſe counſellers, you hear not God; and ſo long as you hear not God, he hath no part in you, neither will he hereafter, if you ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, ſhew mercy unto you.</p>
                  <p>I have one thing more to ſay before I conclude, and that is a word of reproof, even for the Saints and people of God, who though they walk with God in truth and ſinceritie, yet are often worthy to be blamed, in that they wrong the Lord, and their own comforts, by their not hearkning and ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the command of Chriſt, by their not inquiring of him in the firſt place, and by their not reſting upon him when they have his will revealed to them. Theſe are two main weakneſſes and infirmities in the godly themſelves, and they ought to take ſpeciall notice of them. Many a Saint of God there is, that is daily vexing himſelf by poring on his own weakneſſes, by hearing whatſoever carnall reaſons, fleſh and bloud, and ſenſe, can poſſibly raiſe againſt him, together with all the falſe ſuggeſtions and perſwaſions of Satan; and at laſt when he hath wearied and tired himſelf, and knoweth not what to doe, then he goeth home to God, and is contented to hear what he will ſay, whether he will ſpeak comfort to his ſoul or no; and then away with carnall reaſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Satan. My brethren, yee ſhould in the firſt place go to God, and adviſe with him, and hear what his good pleaſure is toward you, and never inquire of your own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is oft another great fault in the people of God, that as they go not to Chriſt in the firſt place for advice and counſell, ſo in the ſecond place when they have it they reſt not upon it. Many a one there is, who after he hath been convinced evidently and clearly, by the power of the word, rightly and ſtrongly applyed, that his eſtate is good before
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114897:77"/>God, and that his conſcience is ſincere, his heart upright, and that the ſpirit of God hath begun an everlaſting work of grace in him, yet notwithſtanding oftentimes relinquiſheth that ground that God hath given him to ſtand upon, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth go that hold that hath been reached out from heaven for him to ſuſtain himſelf by, and returning home again to a view of his own weakneſſes and infirmities, he forſaketh his own mercies and groweth forgetfull of his former comforts, the conſolations of the Almightie ſeem ſmall unto him, hee will not quiet himſelf in that truth which God hath made known, nor reſt upon his word, as he requireth.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but the ſoul replieth, alas, ſhould a man content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a blind perſwaſion that his eſtate is good, and not try his title to heaven, or ſearch whether his intereſt in Chriſt be ſuch as will not deceive him at the laſt?</p>
                  <p>I ſay, Yes, a man ſhould look into himſelf, and examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whether he be in the faith or no; but alwaies let the Lord be Judge, let his word onely paſſe ſentence upon thee: Never Judge thy ſelf barely by what either Satan ſeems to ſuggeſt, or thy own ſinfull weakneſs would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee unto: but when the Word of God is revealed, and his truth manifeſted unto thee; when the Miniſter out of the Seripture hath ſetled thy conſcience, and declared thy caſe good, by ſuch aſſured Evidences, as thou maiſt ſafely build upon, then hold there, and beleeve nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; ſearch your ſelves, but ſtill doe it by the word of God. If this courſe were taken and well obſerved, where there are thouſands of complaints among Chriſtians, there would be ſcarce one. For, my brethren, the ground of all our feebleneſs, and diſtruſt, and diſtemper lieth eſpecially in this, that we neglect our grounds, and doe not fix upon thoſe truths which God hath revealed and made known unto us, either publikely or privately. Hold this therefore for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the beſt direction I can give thee: If my ſoul ſhall be condemned, the word of God ſhall condemn it; If I muſt judge my ſelf to have no grace, the Word of God ſhall ſay it; If I muſt conclude ſalvation as yet belongeth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114897:77"/>me, it ſhall be, becauſe the Word ſaith ſo, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Satan, or my own imagination ſaith ſo. This carrieth thouſands of poor ſouls into manifold diſtempers, becauſe they ſettle not themſelves upon the truth of God, which alwaies ſtandeth as mount Zion unmoveable, and would make them reſt in abundance of peace, in the midſt of all thoſe diſquiets that are raiſed by Satan, and our own diſtruſtfull hearts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in a word, doth the Lord himſelf call for and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this at our hands, the Lord, I ſay, who onely hath right and authority to command us; Doth he injoyn us when he ſpeaks to hear and obey? Oh now therefore, though an unworthy Miniſter cannot perſwade you to yeeld up your ſelves to the practice of this duty, yet let the Lord himſelf prevail with you; and woe to that ſoul that will not bee perſwaded by the Lord himſelf. Take notice of that place before alledged, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. <hi>Every ſoul that will not hear that Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people.</hi> Let every one therefore now in the fear of God obſerve that which Chriſt himſelf injoyneth, and ſo often calleth for in the ſecond and and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation, He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi> The Lord ſaith the ſame now to every ſoul in this place, Let every ſoul that hath an ear to hear, hear what the Lord, ſaith unto him, not onely now, but hereafter, whenſoever God ſhall be pleaſed to reveal any of his counſell to him for his direction. Labour to bring your hearts to that temper we read to have been in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe that he had gathered together to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Miniſterie, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was come, mark what <hi>Cornelus</hi> ſaith to him, <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God.</hi> My brethren, the ſame frame of ſpirit ought we to have, whatſoever it is that the Lord ſhall ſpeak unto us, wee muſt hear him in all things (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) not onely in ſome eaſie kind of dutie, ſuch as every man is willing to imbrace, but in every thing, be it never ſo croſſe to carnall reaſon and corrupt nature; when the Lord teacheth, we muſt bring docile hearts, hearts inlarged to hear

Obſerve what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.24. <hi>Many Prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things which yee ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</hi> What things? Even thoſe that are preached unto you, and made known from day to day, the great things of the Goſpel which are now publiſhed in open view; great men, of great place and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie have deſired to ſee and hear them. The holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Prophets, whoſe ſpirits are now in heaven, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long for Chriſts day: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw it afar off, his eies dazeled in beholding of it. If they rejoyced and delighted in theſe things, ſhould not we much more? Nay, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels come down and delight to pore into theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred myſteries that are now revealed to the people of God; <hi>Which things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Angels deſire to prie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. Thoſe bleſſed ſpirits that are the ſubjects of joy and happineſs, are ſo raviſhed with thoſe glorious myſteries, that they are contented to come to our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, not a ſtep or two, (as we doe, who aſſoon almoſt as we are out of our doors are in the Church) but a great journey, even from heaven, and with a great deal of liking and complacencie they behold the ſervices of Gods people, and are glad to ſee a poor ſoul converted, and report it again in heaven, rejoycing there together, that a ſinner is turned unto God. My brethren, thinke of it; Shall we now that have moſt reaſon to attend theſe things (they being that upon which our everlaſting ſalvation depends) be utterly careleſs of them? Alas, the Angels have the leaſt part in the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner: We are the redeemed, and the ſaved, and we are they that muſt be glorified; and ſhall we have no ears to hear, no hearts to attend to, no deſires to imbrace the Word of Salvation? Oh what a ſhame is it, that we, that have ſo much intereſt in mercie, ſhould have ſo great a neglect of mercy! What then remaineth but this, that we all provoke
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114897:79"/>one another to the performance of this dutie here required of us? that we ſtop our ears to all carnall counſell, to all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Satan, that we hearken to the Lord onely as our Maſter, reſolving to attend to no advice, to follow no dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to obey no commands, but what he ſhall give us?</p>
                  <p>Oh, but will ſome ſay, what is this which you teach us? May not a man hear his carnall friends, may we not follow the advice that they give us? If we ſlight their counſell we may be undome, their anger may be ſuch againſt us, that wee ſhall not be able to bear it. To this Objection I will reply in a word. Will carnall friends be troubled and offended becauſe their words are neglected, and will not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (thinke you) be horribly diſpleaſed, when his commands are deſpiſed? Aſſure your ſelves, my brethren, either you muſt hear the Lord Chriſt now as a Saviour, or you ſhall hear him hereafter as a Judge; either hear him now, ſo as to obey and doe what he requires; or if you refuſe to hear his counſel, expect to hear an horrible ſentence thundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, when he ſhall ſit as Judge at the laſt day, when all your carnall counſellours ſhall not be able to acquit you. You that are wives, and pretend that you muſt pleaſe your husbands, by ſubmitting to their commands and deſires; you that are husbands, and alledge that you muſt give ſatisfaction to your wives; you that are Apprentices, and plead, that if you obſerve not your maſters wills, but walk according to the rule of Gods word, you ſhall be thwarted by your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and driven to ſome great inconvenience; You that ſtand upon the humoring of your friends and acquaintance, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it well; Will the perſwaſions, and counſels, and deſires, and commands of a Father, or friend, or husband, or maſter, ſtand you in ſtead at the day of judgement? Will this be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie anſwer at that day, my husband intreated me, my friends counſelled me, my maſter commanded me? No, my brethren, as you are brethren in iniquitie, and cauſes of ſin one to another, ſo you ſhall periſh both together. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing the terror of the Lord, let that ſcare you more then the anger and diſpleaſure of all the friends in the world.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:114897:80"/>
                  <p>But the truth is (you will anſwer again) they are they that we receive all from, and ſhould we goe contrary to them, and neglect their advice, we muſt reſolve to be poor, and baſe, and mean, all our daies. What a ſilly imagination is this! Put caſe theſe carnall friends bear ſome kinds of reſpect unto thee, and promiſe thee fair, and ſeem able to doe thee good: Can they doe thee good, unleſſe the Lord Chriſt bleſſe what they doe? Is not he able to draw their hearts from thee, or to move them towards thee? Cannot he bleſſe the means, and cannot he curſe them alſo? Thinke of this my brethren, Whether is better for a man, to be inriched, or glorified? To hear an earthly parent, that happily may give him an earthly patrimonie, or an heavenly father that aſſuredly will receive him to mercie in the end of this life? Thinke of theſe things, and withall know, that the means, and helps, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that we deſire, are not properly in the power of friends and acquaintance, but it is God that boweth the hearts and inlargeth the ſpirits of men (whether friends or no) to doe us good. I have known many a carnall man, that having wicked friends, hath been inforced to beſtow moſt upon thoſe whoſe life and practiſe he moſt oppoſed and hated. At leaſtwiſe beleeve for a truth what the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa</hi> 55.3. <hi>Encline your ear, and come unto me, hear, and your ſoul ſhall live.</hi> That is enough me thinks to put to ſilence all ſuch Objections as theſe: What ever carnall friends ſhall perſwade you to, nothing ſhall doe you ſo much good, as the hearing and obeying the voice of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſome will reply and ſay, Alas, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent need of ſuch and ſuch, therefore I muſt either hear them counſelling, or elſe they will not hear me intreating. Oh my brethren, thinke of this; Hath a man, or ſhall a man have need of a friend, and ſhall he not alſo have need of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Muſt a friend be obeyed, becauſe wee have need of him, and ſhall not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be much more obſerved, becauſe we have much more need of him? Haſt thou need of a father or maſter to beſtow ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon thee, and haſt thou not need alſo of a Saviour that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114897:80"/>may deliver thee from ſin here, and from everlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hereafter. Know it, know it, that howſoever now you may neglect the counſell and advice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thinke that you have no need of him, becauſe happily for the preſent your friends ſmile upon you, yet the time will come, when you ſhall find you have more need of Chriſt then of all the world. When a man lieth upon the bed of death, and his eies begin to grow dim, and his breath ſhort, and his pulſe weak, and he ready to goe the way of all fleſh: Oh what good can friends doe him then? all of them together can neither reſtore health, nor preſerve life in that hour. He that now would be our Saviour, hereafter will be our Judge, and will paſſe ſentence upon us one way or other, either of ſalvation or damnation; Shall we not ſtand in need then of his mercy and ſaving health when that day cometh? The ſoul will then wiſh for a dram of mercy, more then for a whole world. Ask a man my brethren, when he is going the way of all fleſh, what then he moſt deſireth, and what he would have at that time eſpecially? Oh will he ſay, mercy, mercy! Oh that the Lord would accept my perſon, and pardon my ſins, and graciouſly look upon me in the face of Chriſt! This is all that the poor ſoul then craveth. But if you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect now to hear the voice of Chriſt, how can you expect that ever he will hear you in that day? It is juſt, it is juſt, my brethren, that you ſhould then have the ſame ſentence that was paſt upon the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.12. They came and knocked hard, and ſpake loud, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us; Away</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I know you not, I know you not:</hi> You would not hear me in the time of your pilgrimage upon the earth, when <hi>I ſent all my ſervants the Prophets, riſing early, and ſending them;</hi> therefore now I will not hear you. But that is not all, I beſeech you to hear it and tremble: The Lord at that day will not only neglect a man that hath neglected him, but he will alſo rejoyce at his deſtruction, and laugh when his fear cometh: Mark what the Text ſaith, and remember it for ever, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114897:81"/>regarded, but yee have ſet at naught all my counſell, and would none of my reproof; I alſo will laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I will mock when your fear cometh.</hi> What a fearfull thing is this, that the God of heaven, the God of mercy ſhould ſolace himſelf in the ruine of all ſuch rebellious wretches, as would not hear and imbrace his bleſſed truth, when he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and manifeſted it to them! When Chriſt ſhall ſay, This is that drunkard, that will not part with his cup for all my perſwaſions and intreaties: This is that adulterer, that would not part with his luſt, notwithſtanding all my calling upon him, and reproving of him: Here is a man that loved his eaſe, his pleaſure, his comforts, his worldly contentments more then me: Here ſtands he that hearkned to the advice of his carnall friends, and wicked companions, and ſet at nought all my counſels and admonitions! Oh my brethren, then ſhall the juſt judgement of God ſink theſe down to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting pit, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth for ever. I ſay no more, but I beſeech you hear me now, that God may hear you at that day. You will have need of a Saviour, and of mercy then: The ſoul longs for nothing in the day of death but pitty and pardon. O make Chriſt your friend now, hear him now, obey him now, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him now, that it may go well with you for ever.</p>
                  <p>If now the command of God cannot carry you, nor theſe Arguments which I have uſed, draw you to yeeld obedience to this truth, yet remember that paſſage <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27, 29. with which I will conclude, and me thinks if you have any good nature in you, it ſhould work much upon you. When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> after they had heard God ſpeak unto them out of the midſt of the thunder, and lightning, <hi>Go thou neer, and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak thou unto us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it, and doe it: The Lord</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>heard the voice of their words, the Lord ſaid, I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have ſpoken unto thee, they have well ſaid all that they have ſpoken: Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114897:81"/>would fear me, and keep all my Commandements alwaies, that it might be well with them for ever.</hi> Mark, my brethren, it is the Lords own requeſt, that there may be an heart in you to hear and obey, that ſo yee may live for ever. Oh therefore if a man cannot prevail with you, yet let the Lord Jeſus Chriſt beg ſo much of you. You may think it ſtrange that the Lord ſhould deſire this at your hands; but it is true, he deſireth it heartily, and he will be exceedingly pleaſed if you ſatisfie his deſire. Well now, ſeeing it is the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that the Lord by me hath made unto you; ask your own ſouls, commune with your own hearts, and tell me what anſwer I ſhall return to the Lord; Shall I ſay you will not hear? My brethren, it is a grievous and tedious thing for a poor Miniſter to give up ſuch an anſwer unto God; I would not willingly have this anſwer from you; therefore I beſeech you, anſwer again: Tell me, what ſhall I ſay? Speak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably as they did, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord our God ſhall ſay, that will we hear and doe.</hi> If ſo, then let me conclude with the anſwer of God, <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in you, and that you would fear the Lord, and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it might be well with you for ever.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> from the 20. verſe of the former Chapter, to the end, diſputeth that great queſtion of juſtification by the free grace of God; and after many Arguments alledged to prove that it is by grace, and not by works, he concludeth in the 28. verſe, <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by Faith with the works of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having diſpatched this, and ſetled his aſſertion by ſtrength of argument in this fourth Chapter, wherein my Text is, he laboureth to make the truth yet more clearer and evident by way of example, and to the end he ſetteth it forth in the lively colour of that faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> giving us an inſtance of this truth, in the example of him, who was the father of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114897:84"/>the faithfull, a father, not by naturall generation, but by imitation; the Lord having appointed him to be the coppy to all the Beleevers of ſucceeding ages; that as he beleeved, and by faith was ſaved, ſo they that doe expect to receive ſalvation, muſt walk in that way, if they purpoſe to partake of that end.</p>
                  <p>Now touching this example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that I may not be long before I come to that, which is the principall point I intend to deliver at this time; the Apoſtle doth two things; firſt, he layeth down the pattern it ſelfe clearly, both in Gods vouchſafing juſtification to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and alſo in Gods ſealing this by the ſeale of circumciſion, and this he doth in the 11. verſe.</p>
                  <p>And as he hath propounded it thus, both in Gods gift, and in Gods ſealing thereof; ſo in the words of the Text he maketh an application of both, applying it to all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children that ſhall live to the end of the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and in effect it is, as if he had ſaid thus; <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was uncircumciſed did beleeve, and ſo was juſtified, therefore they that are uncircumciſed may beleeve, and be alſo juſtified; <hi>Abraham</hi> when he did beleeve was circumciſed, and that hindered not, ſo thoſe that are circumciſed may beleeve and be juſtified, that is, the <hi>Jewes</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have both liberty to come into the Covenant of grace, and ſo alſo to be happy by that Covenant, as <hi>Abraham was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words therefore, you have an application of the former patterne, to the particular uſe of every faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, that look what good <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and what he received by faith, they that beleeve as he did, may expect the ſelfe ſame mercy that he had.</p>
                  <p>Now the faithfull of God, and ſonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> are here deſcribed two wayes: I ſay, every faithfull man that is the ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that imitateth the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is diſcovered two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Negatively, What will not ſuffice to make a man the ſonne of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:114897:84"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Affirmatively, What God ſpecially looks for at the hands of thoſe that are to be the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Negatively thus, Abraham <hi>is the father of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, not onely to them who are of the circumciſion;</hi> that is, not onely theirs who have the priviledges of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the Word, and the Oracles of God, Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover. Tis true; <hi>Abraham</hi> is their father, but not onely theirs that have no more but thoſe priviledges, but alſo theirs, that <hi>walk in the footſteps of the faith of</hi> Abraham. So that by <hi>Circumciſion</hi> you muſt here underſtand all theſe prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives and priviledges which the <hi>Jewes</hi> had above any other Nation; and conſequently, that none of all thoſe priviledges then could, that none of ours, as, to be in the Church, to be baptized, &amp;c. now can make a man to be the ſonne of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Abraham <hi>is the father of the circumciſion, not to them who are of the circumciſion onely;</hi> but he is the father of the circumciſion, if they have faith. They that have bare circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion onely, may indeed applaud themſelves therein, but they ſhall never receive thereby, thoſe things God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. This is the Negative.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Affirmative part ſheweth, who they be indeed that ſhall truly be partakers of the comforts and graces of <hi>Abraham,</hi> namely, thoſe <hi>that walk in the footſteps of that faith of</hi> Abraham. If a man beleeve as he did, work as he did, walk as he did, ſo onely he may come to have title unto, and intereſt in the promiſes God hath vouchſafed in his Word. Thus much for the opening of the words.</p>
                  <p>Come we now in the firſt place to ſpeak of the negative part, in which the Spirit of God is pleaſed to exclude all outward priviledges and prerogatives, and to ſay thus, Abraham <hi>is the father of circumciſion, to them who are not of the circumciſion onely;</hi> that is, if they injoy onely outward priviledges, they are not the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The point we learn hence is thus much;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all outward priviledges, as the hearing of the Word, the partaking of the Sacraments, and the like, are not able to make a man a ſound Saint of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:114897:85"/>
                  <p>The point is clear in the Text, That if a man had circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that is, if he had all thoſe preferments that God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to a people in the face and boſome of his Church, this would not doe him any good at all, he hath no title to the promiſes becauſe of theſe, if he reſt in them: Abraham <hi>is not the father of thoſe that are circumciſed onely:</hi> So that I ſay again, all outward priviledges are not able to make a man a true Saint of God. Our Saviour Chriſt, ſpeaking of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi> ſaith, <hi>And thou</hi> Capernaum, <hi>which art exalted unto heaven, ſhalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in</hi> Sodome, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Capernaum</hi> was <hi>lifted up to Heaven;</hi> how? In all thoſe ſpirituall helpes and excellent meanes that God vouchſafed them above many others; they were highly advanced in the enjoyment of heavenly priviledges, they heard the Word of God, and they ſaw the Miracles of Chriſt; and yet, <hi>Thou Capernaum,</hi> ſhalt be deep in puniſhment; <hi>thou wert lifted up to Heaven,</hi> in regard of excellent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; <hi>but thou ſhalt be caſt down to Hell,</hi> in regard of thy impenitency and ſtubborneſſe under them. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth the point, and makes the caſe clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. where he plucks away all theſe hopes and vain props, which men raiſe to themſelves from the having of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges: <hi>He is not a</hi> Jew, ſaith he, <hi>that is one outwardly,</hi> that is, he is not therefore a true child of God, and a faithfull man, he hath not therefore ſaving faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is circumciſed, becauſe he enjoyeth the liberties and priviledges of the people of God, and liveth in the boſome of the Church; <hi>but he is a</hi> Jew <hi>which is one inwardly, and Circumciſton is that of the heart, in the Spirit and not in the Letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi> You know, that it was an ancient Proverb in <hi>Iſrael, Is</hi> Saul <hi>alſo amongſt the Prophets?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.12. and 19.24. Yes, <hi>Saul</hi> was amongſt the Prophets, and he that was once amongſt the Prophets, is now amongſt the Devils in Hell. <hi>Judas</hi> was highly promoted; he lived as an Apoſtle amongſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, heard out Saviour continually, ſate at table with him,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114897:85"/>and yet for all this, is now damned in hell for ever: Theſe were high priviledges, and if theſe would have done the deed, <hi>Judas</hi> had never periſhed. <hi>Iſhamel</hi> was circumciſed, and yet he was excommunicated out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, the then Church of God, and was a caſt-away. Inſtances are many in the Scriptures to this purpoſe, but I liſt not to dwell longer upon the proofe of the point; you ſee it is evident enough, that bare priviledges, be they never ſo high and excellent, are not able to make one indeed a faithfull man before the Lord, nor the ſonne of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould have ſhewed the Reaſons. Alas! outward matters never work upon the heart. That which makes a man a Saint muſt work upon the ſoul. Now the Word and the Sacraments barely conſidered cannot work upon the ſpirit, unleſſe the Lord work a new frame inwardly by the infuſion of Grace: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Circumciſion and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion profiteth nothing, but faith that worketh by love.</hi> Theſe outward things are too ſhallow to reach the inward man, too weak to work ſo powerfully upon the ſoule of a Chriſtian man, as to bring the heart to God. But I leave the ſtrengthning of the point by Reaſons, and becauſe I would not be prevented, I come to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe I will hence raiſe is an Uſe of reproof. This Doctrine confoundeth the carnall confidence of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that living in the boſome of the Church, place all their hopes and aſſurance of being ſaved upon this bottome: becauſe they have been baptized, and come to Church, and hear the Word, and receive the Sacrament, therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (they preſume) they muſt be accepted of God. This was the old plea of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Jeremies</hi> time: When the Prophet came to them to reprove them for their ſinnes, and preſſe them to repentance, they began to quarrell with him, and to take up Bucklers againſt him, and cried out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Fig-leaves</hi> wherewith poor and ignorant. Chriſtians think to hide themſelves at this day. Tell them of their ſaults, bid them walk humbly and holily before God, reprove them
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114897:86"/>for their ſtrange practiſes againſt God and his truth, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning his day, blaſpheming his name, contemning his Word, deſpiſing his Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they preſently cry out againſt us: What will you make Pagans of us? What do you thinke we are Heathens? Have we not received Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Baptiſme? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a bottome that beareth up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: But oh poor ſilly creatures, this will not doe it; be not deceived, you will ſhrink under this ſhelter, you will fall notwithſtanding theſe props, when you come to tryall; you may have all this, and yet periſh, this will not make you Saints in the ſight of God. You that are Tradeſmen, is it a good argument, that becauſe have good ware in your ſhops, therefore you have no refuſe, no drug commodity? or you that are husbandmen, becauſe ſome good corn grows upon your ground, is it therefore all good corne? Who knows not that there is Cockle amongſt corn, and bad wares even in your beſt ſhops. So it is true here, as there are many hearers in hell, and many receivers in hell, ſo there are too many in the boſome of the Church, enjoying the outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Gods people, that ſhall never receive good by all that they partake of.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I beſeech you be not deceived, truſt not to theſe lying words, and vain hopes, <hi>The Sacrament of the Lord, and the Church, and the Church;</hi> I ſay, truſt not to theſe <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities.</hi> A man may, as <hi>Judas,</hi> not onely have the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in his hand, but Chriſt in his mouth, and goe to Hell notwithſtanding. Alas, at the day of judgement, if thou haſt nothing to ſay but this, Lord, I was a hearer of thy Word, a receiver at thy Table, a frequenter of thy houſe, thou canſt expect no other anſwer, but <hi>Depart from me, I know thee not.</hi> He is not the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> that hath Circumciſion onely, but <hi>that walketh in the ſteps of the faith of Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, here is a word of Exhortation, and that is this; We ought hereby to be inſtructed, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to ſtir up our ſoules, and not to content our ſelves with, or ſettle our ſelves in theſe outward ſhaddows, but to labour
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114897:86"/>to go further, and beyond all that theſe outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges barely, as outward priviledges, can make us; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy theſe, but to ſtrive to be bettered by them; not onely to have the Word, and the Sacraments, but to improve them; to get more then the outward ſhell, to labour for the kernell, for the comfort of them. Therefoee I would adviſe a Chriſtian man that liveth in the boſome of the Church, where the Lord is pleaſed to continue helps and means to him, as to eſteem them great priviledges (for ſo they are) ſo not to content himſelf with the outward enjoyment of them, but to call upon himſelf, and to look inward, to ſee what the heart ſaith. Outward things will not doe the deed; look we therefore for ſomewhat more, that will ſtand us in ſtead when the Lord cometh with <hi>his fan in his hand, throughly to purge his floor,</hi> and to make a diviſion between the <hi>wheat</hi> and the <hi>chaffe.</hi> Take notice of it therefore, and underſtand for your ſpirituall good: When thou comeſt to the houſe of God, and bringeſt thine hands to receive the Sacrament, and thine eares to liſten to the word; thinke with thy ſelf, I have heard the Word, I have received the Sacrament, but O heart what ſayeſt thou? Have I embraced theſe promiſes? Have I cloſed with thoſe precepts that have been delivered? Have I eaten Chriſt in the Sacrament? Hath my faith pitched on him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited there, under the Elements of Bread and Wine? How often have I already lived under the call of God, and yet have rejected it? my ſoul is not yet humbled; I onely come and hear, and return without any benefit; therefore now I will go further, and dig deeper, that my heart may be brought to the obedience of the truth. Mark what our Saviour Chriſt faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 49 provoking the Jews to beleeve in him, and ſo to receive mercy by him, he ſpeaks on this manner, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to goe further then outward things; <hi>Your fathers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eat Manna in the Wilderneſs, and are dead.</hi> Who are thoſe Fathers? Thoſe ſtubborn and rebellious Jewes that fell in the Wilderneſſe: <hi>Theſe entred not becauſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Now Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Your Fathers eat Manna, and are dead;</hi> he meaneth are
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114897:87"/>damned; for he ſaith afterward, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 51. <hi>If any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever;</hi> thereby ſhewing a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the faithfull, and unbeleevers, though both die a naturall death: I ſay, making a difference between the rebellious Jews, that did not beleeve, and thoſe that did beleeve: <hi>Your Fathers eat Manna in the wilderneſs,</hi> a Type and a Sacrament indeed to them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it; but that would not doe the deed, though the Manna came from heaven, yet it could not bring them up to heaven, it could not free them from eternall death; But here is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of beleeving, and of right receiving; He that doth not onely receive bread, but Chriſt, he that eateth this food, this bread, he ſhall never die any more, he cannot periſh: Labour therefore for this evermore: As when the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> heard our Saviour ſpeak of <hi>living water</hi> that would continue for ever, She cryed out preſently, <hi>Oh Sir, give me of this water, that I thirſt no more, Joh.</hi> 4.15. So labour for this food above all: Labour to ſettle your ſouls, and to reſt your hearts ſtill upon theſe reſolutions; Oh what have I that a carnall man may not have? What doe I that that a carnall man cannot doe? I would have a Chriſtian man, to go beyond all thoſe that live in the boſome of the Church. I ſay therefore, let this be the Queſtion, and examine thine heart: What doe I more then the damned in hell have done I pray? The truth is, the fooliſh Virgins knocked too: I preach, ſo did <hi>Judas:</hi> Doe I reform many things, So did <hi>Herod:</hi> Was I baptized? So was <hi>Simon Magnus?</hi> In a word, am I reſolved to confeſſe my ſins and to make ſatisfaction for them? Alas <hi>Judas</hi> did all this, and yet this would not ſerve the turn; he ſorrowed, and repented, and when he had done, he went and hanged himſelf: It was not godly ſorrow that cauſed repentance to ſalvation, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented onely for the gall of ſin, not for the ſoul of ſin. Labour we therefore, and let us every one provoke another to go further then ever reprobates went; in praying, and hearing, and profeſſing, labour for ſomething that will ſtand us in ſtead in the day of tryall, <hi>When the heavens ſhall bee
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114897:87"/>rolled together as a ſcrole, Iſai.</hi> 34.4. that we may appear before the Lord, and receive a reward from him in his appointed time and ſeaſon. So much for the Negative Part.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to the Affirmative: Who thoſe are, that may, and doe indeed, receive benefit as <hi>Abraham</hi> did? The Text ſaith, <hi>They that walk in the ſteps of that faith of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham: That man, that not onely enjoyeth the Priviledges of the Church, but yeeldeth the obedience of faith, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God revealed, and walketh in obedience, that man alone ſhall be bleſſed with faithfull <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two points may be hence raiſed, but I ſhall hardly handle them both, therefore I will paſſe over the firſt onely with a touch, and that lieth cloſely couched in the Text,</p>
                  <p>That, <hi>Faith cauſeth fruitfulneſs in the hearts and lives of thoſe in whom it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark what I ſay, A faithfull man, is a fruitfull man: Faith inableth a man to be doing. Ask the Queſtion, By what power was it whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> was inabled to yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Lord? The Text anſwereth you, <hi>They that walke in the footſteps</hi> not <hi>of Abraham,</hi> but <hi>in the footſteps of the faith of Abraham.</hi> A man would have thought the Text ſhould have run thus, <hi>They that walk in the footſteps of Abraham,</hi> that is true too, but the Apoſtle had another end, therefore he ſaith, <hi>They that walk in the footſteps of the faith of Abraham,</hi> implying, that it was the grace of faith that God beſtowed on <hi>Abraham,</hi> that quickned and inabled him to every duty that God required of him, and called him to the performance of. So that I ſay, the Queſtion being, Whence came it that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſo fruitfull a Chriſtian, what inabled him to do, and to ſuffer what he did? Surely it was faith that was the cauſe that produced ſuch Effects, that helped him to perform ſuch actions. The Point then you ſee is evident, Faith is it that cauſoth fruit.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that of almoſt all the actions that a Chriſtian haah to doe, faith is ſtill ſaid to be the worker. If a man pray as he ſhould, it is <hi>the prayer of faith, Jam.</hi> 5.15. If a man
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114897:88"/>obey as he ſhould it <hi>is the obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. If a man war in the Church militant, it is <hi>the fight of faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. If a man live as a Chriſtian and holy man, he <hi>liveth by fasth, Gal.</hi> 2.20. Nay ſhall I ſay yet more, if he die as he ought, <hi>he dieth by faith,</hi> Heb. 11.13. <hi>Theſe all died in faith.</hi> What is that? by the power of faith that directed and ordered them in the courſe of their death, furniſhed them with grounds and principles of aflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the love of God, made them carry themſelves pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in death. I can ſay no more, but with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether yee bee in the faith.</hi> Why doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Examine whether faith be in you,</hi> but <hi>whether yee bee in the faith?</hi> His meaning is, that as a man is ſaid, <hi>to be in drinke,</hi> or to <hi>be in love,</hi> or to <hi>bee in paſſion,</hi> that is, under the command of drinke, or love, or paſſion; ſo the whole man muſt be under the command of faith: (as you ſhall ſee more afterwards) If he pray, faith muſt indite his prayer; If he obey, faith muſt work; If hee live, it is faith that muſt quicken him; and if he die, it is faith that muſt order him in death: And whereſoever faith is, it will doe wonders in the ſoul of that man where it is, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be idle, it will have <hi>footſteps,</hi> it ſets the whole man on work, it moveth feet, and hands, and cies, and all parts of the bodie. Mark how the Apoſtle diſputeth, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.13. <hi>We having the ſame ſpirit of faith, according as it is written, I beleeved, and therefore have I ſpoken, we alſo believe, and therefore ſpeak:</hi> The faith of the Apoſtle which he had in his heart, ſet his tongue a going: If a man have faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it will break forth at his mouth. This ſhall ſuffice for the proof of the point; I thought to have preſſed it further, but if I ſhould, I ſee the time would prevent me.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe therefore in a word is this: If this be ſo, then it falleth ſoul, and is a heavie Bill of Indictment againſt many that live in the boſome of the Church. Go thy wayes home, and read but this Text, and conſider ſeriouſly but this one thing in it; <hi>That whoſoever is the ſon of Abraham, hath faith, and whoſoever hath faith, is a walker, is a worker;</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:114897:88"/>by the footſteps of faith you may ſee where faith hath been: Will not this then, I ſay, fall marvellous heavie upon many ſouls that live in the boſome of the Church, who are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and put it out of all Queſtion, that they are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and make no doubt but that they have faith? But look to it, whereſoever faith is, it is fruitfull: If thou art fruitleſſe, ſay what thou wilt, thou haſt no faith at all. Alas theſe idle Drones; theſe idle Chriſtians the Church is too too full of them. Men are continually hearing, and yet remain fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unprofitable; whereas if there were more faith in the world, we ſhould have more work done in the world; faith would ſet feet, and hands, and eies, and all on work. Men go under the name of profeſſors, but alas they are but Pictures, they ſtir not a whit; Mark, Where you found them in the beginning of the yeer, there you ſhall find them in the end of the yeer, as profane, as worldly, as looſe in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, as formall in dutie as ever: And is this faith? Oh faith would work other matters, and provoke a ſoul to other paſſages then theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But you wil ſay, May not a man have faith, and not that fruit you ſpeak of? May not a man have a good heart to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, although he cannot find that abilitie in matter of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My brethren, be not deceived, Such an opinion is a meer deluſion of Satan; whereever faith is, it bringeth Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul; Mark that, Whoſoever beleeveth, <hi>Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in his heart by faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. And, <hi>If Chriſt be in you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the body is dead, becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 8.10. <hi>If Chriſt be in you,</hi> that is, Whoſoever beleeveth in the Lord Jeſus, Chriſt dwels in ſuch a man by faith; now if Chriſt be in the ſoul, the bodie cannot be dead; but a man is alive, and quick, and active to holy duties, ready, and willing, and cheerfull in the performance of whatſoever God requireth; Chriſt is not a dead Saviour, nor the Spirit a dead Spirit; <hi>The ſecond Adam is made a quickning ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. And wherever the Spirit is, it works Effects ſuteable to it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114897:89"/>The Spirit is a Spirit of puritie, a ſpirit of zeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and where it is, it maketh pure and zealous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When a man will ſay he hath faith, and in the mean time can be content to be idle and unfruitfull in the work of the Lord, can bee content to be a dead Chriſtian, let him know, that his caſe is marvellouſly fearfull: For if faith were in him indeed, it would appear, yee cannot keep your good hearts to your ſelves, where ever fire is, it will burn, and where ever faith is, it cannot be kept ſecret: The heart will be inlarged, the ſoul quickned, and there will be a change in the whole life and converſation, if ever faith take place in a man. I will ſay no more of this, but proceed to the Second point, ariſing out of the Affirmative part.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, What fruit is it then? Or how ſhall a man know what is the true fruit of faith indeed, whereby he may diſcern his own eſtate? I anſwer, The Text will tell you: <hi>He that walketh in the footſteps of that faith of Abraham:</hi> By <hi>footſteps</hi> are meant the works, the actions, the holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and where thoſe footſteps are, there is the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> So that the point of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction hence is thus much, (which indeed is the main drift of the Apoſtle)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That,</hi> Every faithfull man may, yea doth imitate the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faithfull <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark what I ſay, I ſay again, This is to be the Son of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raham,</hi> not becauſe we are begotten of him by naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; for ſo the Jews are the ſons of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is our father, becauſe he is the pattern for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of our faith. <hi>Thy father was an Amorite,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3. that is, Thou followeſt the ſteps of the <hi>Amorites</hi> in thy converſation. So is <hi>Abraham</hi> called the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithfull,</hi> becauſe he is the copie of their courſe, whom they muſt follow in thoſe ſervices that God calleth for. So the point is clear, <hi>Every faithfull man may, yea, doth, and muſt imitate the actions of faithfull Abraham.</hi> It is Chriſts own plea, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.39. and he preſſeth it as an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114897:89"/>truth apon the hearts of the Scribes and Phariſees, that bragged very highly of their priviledges and prerogatives, and ſaid, Abraham <hi>is our father:</hi> No, ſaith Chriſt; <hi>If yee were</hi> Abraham's <hi>children, yee would doe the works of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. To be like <hi>Abraham</hi> in conſtitution, to be one of his bloud, is not that which makes a man a ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to be like him in holineſſe of affection, to have a heart framed, and a life diſpoſed anſwerably to his. The Apoſtle in like manner preſſeth this point, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7. when he would provoke the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> to whom he wrote, to follow the examples of the Saints; <hi>Whoſe faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>follow, conſidering the end of their converſation.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preſſeth the example of <hi>Sarah</hi> upon all good women; <hi>Whoſe daughters yee are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as long as yee doe well,</hi> 1 Pet. 36.</p>
                  <p>For the opening of the point, and that yee may more clearly underſtand it. A queſtion here would be reſolved, What were <hi>the footſteps of the faith of</hi> Abraham? which way went he? This is a queſtion, I ſay, worthy the ſcanning, and therefore (leaving the further confirmation of the point, as being aleady evident enough) I will come to it, that ſo you may know what to pitch and ſettle your hearts upon.</p>
                  <p>I aniwer therefore,<note place="margin">Six foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith.</note> There are ſix footſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which are the main things wherein every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man muſt doe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, in the work of faith, I mean, in his ordinary courſe: for if there be any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, no man is bound to imitate him therein; but in the work of faith, I ſay, which belongeth to all men, every man muſt imitate <hi>Abraham</hi> in theſe ſix ſteps, and then he is in the next door to happineſſe, the very next neighbour, as I may ſay, to heaven.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſtep which <hi>Abraham</hi> took in the wayes of grace and happineſſe, you ſhall obſerve, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. to be a yeelding to the call of God. Mark what God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers houſe, unto a land that I will ſhew thee: And</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>departed,</hi> ſaith the Text, Verſe 4. <hi>as the Lord had ſpoken
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114897:90"/>unto him,</hi> even when he was an Idolater: he is content to lay aſide all, and let the command of God bear the ſway; neither friends, nor kindred, nor gods can keep him back, but he preſently ſtoopeth to the call of God. So it is, my brethren, with every faithfull man: This is his firſt ſtep; He is contented to be under the rule and power of Gods command. Let the Lord call for him, require any ſervice of him, his ſoule preſently yeeldeth, and is content to be framed and faſhioned to Gods call, and returneth an obedient anſwer thereto: he is content to come out of his ſinnes, and out of himſelfe, and to receive the impreſſions of the Spirit. This is that which God requireth, not onely of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but of all beleevers: <hi>Whoſoever will be my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>muſt forſake father, and mother, and wife, and children, and houſes, and lands; yea, and he muſt deny himſelfe, and take up his Croſſe, and follow me.</hi> This is the firſt ſtep in Chriſtianity, to lay down our own honours, to trample upon our own reſpects, to ſubmit our necks to the block as it were, and whatſoever God commands, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that his good pleaſure ſhould take place with us.</p>
                  <p>Nay, yet further, <hi>Abraham</hi> was not content onely to leave his country, and kindred, and fathers houſe, but he left his goods alſo: The Text ſaith, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.2. <hi>Your fathers dwelt on the other ſide of the floud in old time, even</hi> Terah <hi>the father of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the father of</hi> Nachor; <hi>and they ſerved other Gods. Abraham</hi> was an Idolater before God called him; but as ſoon as God called him he left his gods behind him, and God onely ſhould be his God, to exerciſe rule and authority over him in every particular.</p>
                  <p>And this is not all yet: My brethren, I beſeech you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; <hi>Abraham</hi> did not this as one conſtrained and forced thereunto; but ſo as he would not return any more: and that is a paſſage very obſervable; <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15. <hi>if he had been mindfull of the country from whence he came out, he might have had opportunity to have returned.</hi> If he would have gone back again, he had liberty enough; but he would have no more kindred, nor no more
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114897:90"/>fathers houſe, nor no other gods, becauſe he knew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God was otherwiſe; therefore he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn though he might; intimating that he was not drawn from his country by a kind of force, but he ſo voluntarily yeelded up himſelfe to the command of God, and that ſo prevailed with him, that he would never return any more. But the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they were brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet they returned back thither in their hearts: So the Text ſpeakes; <hi>They thought of the Fiſh which they did eat there freely; the Cucumbers, and the Melons, and the Leeks, and the Onions, and the Garlick, Numb.</hi> 11.5. and their mindes ran after <hi>the fleſh-pots of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. Many a time a carnall wretch commeth ſo farre, as that when God knocks his fingers off his ſinnes, he lets them goe for a time, but his heart is ſtill bent after his former courſes, and he lingereth after them ſtill: ſo was it not with <hi>Abraham:</hi> And this is the firſt <hi>ſtep of the faith of</hi> Abraham, that he was content to yeeld to the call, and to be under the command of God, to let his good pleaſure take place in his heart, to leave all, kindred, country, fathers houſe, and never return any more. And this is that firſt ſtep that God lookes every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man ſhould take, that he be willing, that the command of God take place in his heart, that God ſhould make room there for himſelfe, that he ſhould pluck away his deareſt ſinnes, that are as neer to him as his right hand, and as his right eye. If the Adulterer were converted, he would be contented that God ſhould take away his luſt, that is as dear to him as his very ſoule; nay, he would fain, and that with all his heart, have God make way in his ſoul for his own Majeſty, by beating down all the holds of Satan, and tumbling that <hi>Dagon</hi> to the ground which ſtandeth before him. This is the firſt ſtep of faith.</p>
                  <p>The next ſtep that <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo every faithfull ſoule, ſets forward, is this; That when ever faith commeth power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into the heart, the ſoule is not content barely to yeeld to the command of God, but it breatheth after his mercy, longeth for his grace, prizeth Chriſt and Salvation above
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114897:91"/>all things in the world, is ſatisfied and contented with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but with the Lord Chriſt: and although it partake of many things below, and injoy abundance of outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, yet it is not quieted till it reſt and pitch it ſelfe upon the Lord, and find and feel that evidence and aſſurance of his love, which he hath promiſed unto, and will beſtow on thoſe who love him: As for all things here below, he hath but a ſlight, and mean, and baſe eſteem of them. This you ſhall ſee apparent in <hi>Abraham: Gen.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>Feare not</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, (ſaith God) <hi>I am thy ſheild, and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> What could a man deſire more? One would think that the Lord makes a promiſe here large enough to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; I will be thy Buckler, and exceeding great reward:</hi> Is not <hi>Abraham</hi> contented with this? No; mark how he pleadeth with God; <hi>Lord God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I goe childleſſe?</hi> His eye is upon the promiſe that God had made to him of a ſonne, of whom the Saviour of the world ſhould come. <hi>Oh Lord, what wilt thou give me?</hi> as if he had ſaid, What wilt thou doe for me? alas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will doe my ſoule good, unleſſe I have a ſonne, and in him a Saviour. What will become of me, ſo long as I goe childleſſe, and ſo ſaviourleſſe, as I may ſo ſpeak? You ſee how <hi>Abraham</hi>'s mouth was out of taſt with all other things, how he could reliſh nothing, injoy nothing in compariſon of the promiſe, though he had otherwiſe what he would, or could deſire. Thus muſt it be with every faithfull man. That ſoule never had, nor never ſhall have Chriſt, that doth not prize him above all things in the world: no certainly; a faithfull ſoule breatheth after nothing ſo much as mercy in Chriſt, lookes after, and longeth for nothing ſo much as the aſſurance of the love of God. Though all the comforts of this world were afforded a faithfull man, yet ſtill he would plead with the Lord, Oh Lord, what will become of me notwithſtanding all this, ſo long as my ſoule is comfortleſſe? what availeth it me to live here? Oh thy Mercy! Oh thy Salvation! Oh the Lord Chriſt! theſe are the things my ſoule breatheth after. This, my brethren, is the nature of faith, if it be rightly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114897:91"/>wrought in the ſoul, as you ſhall fee and find by ordinary experience. For take a man that is truly awakened, and whoſe conſcience is throughly touched, and offer him crowns, and ſcepters, and honours, and all the delights of the ſons of men; alas, his ſoul will care nothing for them, but as <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.32. <hi>Behold, I am at the point to die, and what profit ſhall this birthright doe to me?</hi> So will the poor ſoul ſay, What will it avail me, to be high in the favour of men here, and to be a fiend of Hell hereafter? What are all theſe profits and pleaſures to me ſo long as I am not in the favour of God? What good can theſe outward content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments afford me when I am without Chriſt? Oh Lord, what wilt thou give me, unleſſe I have my Saviour, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in him, and pardon in him, and all in him, and through him? Still thus beateth the pulſe of a faithfull ſoule; and this is the nature of ſaving faith, the faith of Gods elect. As for theſe things here below, theſe matters of the world, they are little in the regard and eſteem of a Chriſtian man: If he have them, he ſeeth God in them; If he want them, he is never a whit the worſe. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and the faithfull people of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſaith, That they let their hold goe of all theſe things below; let the world take the world if they would, let the dead bury their dead; but as for them, <hi>Having ſeen the promiſes afar off, they were perſwaded of them, and imbraced them, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth,</hi> even in that country that God had promiſed them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>The third ſtep of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith was this, He caſteth himſelf and flingeth his ſoul (as I may ſay) upon the all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power and mercie of God for the attainment of what he deſireth, he rolleth and tumbleth himſelf as it were upon the all-ſufficiencie of God. This you ſhall finde <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. there ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Abrahyam, Who againſt hope, beleeved in hope;</hi> That is, when there was no hope in the world, yet he beleeved in God even above hope, and ſo made it poſſible; It was an object of his hope, that it might be in regard of God, howſoever there was no poſſibilitie in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114897:92"/>regard of man. So the Text ſaith, <hi>He conſidered not his own bodie now dead, when he was about an hundred yeers old, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet the deadneſs of</hi> Sarahs <hi>wombe, but was ſtrong in faith.</hi> He caſt himſelf wholly upon the precious promiſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God.</p>
                  <p>This then is the third ſtep of true juſtifying faith, That when the beleever is informed touching the excellencie of the Lord Jeſus, and that fulneſs that is to be had in him, though he cannot find the ſweetneſſe of his mercy, though he cannot, or dare not apprehend, and apply it to himſelf, though he find nothing in himſelf, yet he is ſtill reſolved to reſt upon the Lord, and to ſtay himſelf on the God of his ſalvation, and to wait for his mercy till he find him gracious to his poor ſoul. Excellent and famous is that example of the woman of <hi>Canaan, Matth.</hi> 15.22, 27. When Chriſt as it were beat her off, and took up arms againſt her, was not pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal himſelf graciouſly to her for the preſent; <hi>I am not ſent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> And, <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it to dogs:</hi> Mark how ſhe replyed, <hi>Truth, Lord,</hi> I confeſſe all that; <hi>yet</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their maſters table.</hi> O the excellency, and ſtrength and work of her faith! Shee comes to Chriſt for mercy, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth her, reproacheth her, tells her ſhee is a dog; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth her baſenes, yet is not diſcouraged for all that, but ſtill reſteth upon the goodneſs and mercie of Chriſt, and is mightily reſolved to have mercie whatſoever befalleth her. Truth Lord, I confeſſe I am as bad as thou canſt term me, yet I confeſſe too that there is no comfort but from thee, and though I am a dog, yet I would have crumbes: Still ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to catch after mercy, and to lean and bear her ſelfe upon the favour of Chriſt, for the beſtowing thereof upon her. So it muſt be with every faithfull Chriſtian in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; he muſt roll himſelf upon the power and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and truth of God, and wait for his mercy: (I will joyn them both together for brevities ſake, though this latter bee a fourth ſtep and degree of faith) I ſay, he muſt not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114897:92"/>upon God, but he muſt wait upon the holy one of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text ſaith of <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 6.15. <hi>That after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promiſe;</hi> he received the performance after he had a little waited for it. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 101.2. <hi>I will walke in the uprightneſſe of my heart till the Lord come to me:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, If the Lord will abſent himſelf from me, and not reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me, yet wait I will, and deſire I will, and ſtill I will be hoping for the mercie of the Lord till he come to me. So it was ſaid of <hi>Simeon,</hi> that good old man, <hi>That he waited for the conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2.25. <hi>Mine eies</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.123.) <hi>grow dim for the looking for thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. He that belceveth makes not haſte,</hi> Iſai. 28.16. he makes haſt to obey, but makes not haſt to bring mercie from God.</p>
                  <p>The fifth ſtep of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith appeared in this; Hee counted nothing too dear for the Lord, he was content to break through all impediments, to paſſe through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whatſoever God would have, he had of him. This is the next ſtep that <hi>Abraham</hi> went; and this you ſhall finde <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. when God put him upon the tryall. The Text ſaith there, <hi>That God did tempt Abraham,</hi> did try what he would doe for him, and he bade him, <hi>Go, take thy ſon, thy onely ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and ſtay him:</hi> And ſtraight <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> went and laid his ſon upon an Altar, and took a knife to cut the throat of his ſon: So that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not ſpare his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he did not ſpare for any coſt, he did not dodge with God in this caſe; if God would have any thing, hee ſhould have it whatſoever it were, though it were his own life, for no queſtion <hi>Iſaac</hi> was dearer to him then his own life. And this was not his caſe alone, but the faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have ever walked the ſame courſe. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was of the ſame ſpirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22, 24. <hi>I know not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the things that ſhall befall me, ſave that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every Citie ſaying, That bonds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions abide me: but none of theſe things move me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114897:93"/>count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſterie which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi> Oh bleſſed ſpirit! here is the work of faith. Alas, when we come to part with any thing for the cauſe of God, how hardly comes it from us? But I, ſaith he, <hi>paſſe not, no, nor is my life dear unto me.</hi> Here I ſay, is the work of faith indeed, when a man is content to doe any thing for God, and to ſay, If impriſonment, loſſe of eſtate, libertie, life, come I paſſe not, it moveth me nothing, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with comfort. Hence it was that the Saints of God in thoſe Primitive times, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>took joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods.</hi> Me thinks I ſee the Saints there reaching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt with the arms of faith, and how when any thing lay in their way, they were content to loſe all, to part with all, to have Chriſt. Therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 21.13. <hi>I am rerdy not to be bound onely, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Mark, rather then he would leave his Saviour, he would leave his life, and though men would have hindred him, yet was reſolved to have Chriſt howſoever, though he loſt his life for him: Oh let me have my Saviour, and take my life.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſtep of all is this, When the ſoul is thus reſolved not to dodge with God, but to part with any thing for him: then in the laſt place there followeth a readineſſe of heart to addreſſe a mans ſelf to the performance of whatſoever dutie God requireth at his hands; I ſay, this is the laſt ſtep, when without conſulting with fleſh and blood, without hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon it, as it were, without aukwardneſſe of heart, there followeth a preſtneſs to obey God, the ſoul is at hand. When <hi>Abraham</hi> was called, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>here I am,</hi> Gen. 22.1. And ſo <hi>Samuel, Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.9. and ſo <hi>Ananias, Behold,</hi> I <hi>am here Lord,</hi> Acts 9.10. The faithfull ſoul is not to ſeek, as an evill ſervant that is gone a roving after his companions, that is out of the way when his maſter ſhould uſe him, but is like a truſty ſervant that waiteth upon his maſter, and is ever at hand to doe his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114897:93"/>pleaſure. So you ſhall ſee it was with <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 11. 8. When the Lord commanded him to goe out of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>He obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went;</hi> he went chearfully and readily, though he knew not whither; as who ſhould ſay, if the Lord call, I will not queſtion; if he command, I will performe what ever it be. So it muſt be with every faithfull ſoule: we muſt blind the eye of carnall reaſon, reſolve to obey, though heaven and earth ſeem to meet together in a contradiction, care not what man, or what devill ſaith in this caſe, but what God will have done, doe it: This is the courage and obedience of faith. See how Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the place before named, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.12, 13. flung his ancient friends from him, when they came to croſſe him in the work of his miniſtry: They all came about him, and becauſe they thought they ſhould ſee his face no more, they beſought him not to goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem; Then</hi> Paul <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, What mean yee to weep, and to break my heart?</hi> as who ſhould ſay, it is a greif and vexation to my ſoule, that yee would hinder me, that I cannot goe with readineſſe to performe the ſervice that God requireth at my hands. The like Chriſtian courage was in <hi>Luther,</hi> when his friends diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to goe to <hi>Wormes; If all the Tiles in</hi> Wormes <hi>were ſo many Devils,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>yet would I goe thither in the name of my Lord Jeſus.</hi> This is the laſt ſtep.</p>
                  <p>Now gather up a little what I have delivered. He that is reſolved to ſtoop to the call of God; to prize the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and breath after them; to reſt upon the Lord, and to wait his time for beſtowing mercy upon him; to break through all impediments and difficulties, and to count no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too deare for God; to be content to performe ready and cheerful obedience; he that walketh thus, and treadeth in theſe ſteps; peace be upon him, Heaven is hard by, he is as ſure of ſalvation as the Angels are, it is as certain as the Lord liveth, that he ſhall be ſaved with faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he walketh in the ſteps of <hi>Araham,</hi> and therefore he is ſure to be where he is. The caſe you ſee is clear, and the point evident, that every faithfull man may, and muſt imitate faithfull <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:114897:94"/>
                  <p>It may be here imagined, that we draw men up to too high a pitch: and certainly, if this be the ſenſe of the words, and the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in this place, what will become of many that live in the boſome of the Church? Will you therefore ſee the point confirmed by reaſon? The ground of this Doctrine ſtandeth thus; Every faithfull man hath the ſame faith, for nature and for work, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had; therefore look what nature his faith was of, and what power it had, of the ſame nature and power every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers faith is. Breifly thus; The promiſes of God are the ground upon which all true faith reſteth; the Spirit of God it is that worketh this faith in all beleevers; the power of the ſpirit is that that putteth forth it ſelfe in the hearts and lives of all the faithfull; gather theſe together; if all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers have the ſame promiſes for the ground of their faith, have one and the ſame ſpirit to work it, have one and the ſame power to draw out the abilities of faith, then certainly they cannot but have the very ſelfe ſame actions, having the very ſelfe ſame ground of their actions. Every particular beleever (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.) <hi>hath obtained the like precious faith.</hi> Mark that: There is a great deal of Copper-faith in the world, much counterfeit belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but the Saints doe all partake of the <hi>like precious faith.</hi> As when a man hath but a Sixpence in ſilver, or a Crown in gold, thoſe ſmall pieces for the nature, are as good as the greateſt of the ſame metall; ſo it is with the faith of Gods Elect. And look as it is in graffing; If there be many Scions of the ſame kind graſſed into one ſtock, they all partake alike of the vertue of the ſtock; juſt ſo it is here: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the ſtock, as it were, into which all the faithfull are grafted by the ſpirit of God and faith; therefore whatſoever fruit one beareth, another beareth alſo: howſoever there may be degrees of works, yet they are the ſame for nature. As a little Apple is the ſame in taſt with a great one of the ſame tree, even ſo every faithfull man hath the ſame holineſſe of heart and life, becauſe he hath the ſame principle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The fruit indeed that one Chriſtian bringeth forth,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114897:94"/>may be but poor and ſmall in compariſon of others, yet it is the ſame in kind: the courſe of his life is not with ſo much power and fulneſſe of grace, it may be, as anothers, yet there is the ſame true grace, and the ſame practiſe in the kind of it for truth, however in degree it differ.</p>
                  <p>Here by way of caution I will ſuggeſt too things to you.
<list>
                        <item>1. That howſoever all beleevers have the ſelfe ſame nature of faith, yet all muſt not look to have the ſame meaſure of faith, and the ſame degree of works.</item>
                        <item>2. That faith doth not performe all its works at one time, but groweth to a ripeneſſe upon ſeverall occaſions. A Child is a perfect man in regard of parts, though not of degrees: he is able to eat, and to ſee, though he cannot walk and talk; yet becauſe he hath a reaſonable ſoule as well as others, he will walk and talk like others in due time: So howſoever many of the Saints of God have not attained to thoſe great actions of grace that others have, yet having the ſame ſpirit and principle of grace within, they ſhall be inabled hereafter to a further diſcharge of thoſe holy ſervices that God requireth. Thus you ſee the point confirmed by reaſon; if all the Saints of God are ingraffed into Chriſt indifferently, if all have the ſame ground of faith, and the ſame ſpirit to work it, and to make it work, they muſt needs have the ſame actions and fruits of faith, becauſe (I ſay) they have the ſelfe ſame cauſes of their faith.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now come to ſee what benefit we may make to our ſelves of this point, thus proved and confirmed: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Uſe of this Doctrine is of great conſequence. In the firſt place it is a juſt ground of Examination: For if it be true (as it cannot be denyed, the reaſons being ſo ſtrong, and arguments ſo plain) that every ſonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> followeth the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then here you may clearly perceive who it is that hath ſaving faith indeed, who they be that are true Saints, and the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> By the light of this truth, by the rule of this doctrine, if you would ſquare your courſes, and look into your converſations, you cannot but diſcern whether you have faith or no. That man whoſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114897:95"/>faith ſhe weth it ſelfe, and putteth it ſelfe forth in its ſeverall conditions agreable to the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that man that followeth the footſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> let him be eſteemed a faithfull man, let him be reckoned for a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever. But if any mans faith doe not this, but be contrary unto, or fall ſhort of this in the truth (I ſay, not in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) of it, certainly it is counterfeit, it is Copper-faith. O the world of counterfeit faith then, that is in the Church at this day! It was the complaint of our Saviour Chriſt, that <hi>when he ſhould come, he ſhould ſcarce finde faith on the earth, Luke</hi> 18.8. as if he ſhould ſay, It will be ſo little, and ſo rare, that one ſhall hardly know where to find a faithfull man. It was the complaint of the Pſalmiſt of old, and is moſt true of theſe times, that <hi>the faithfull faile from among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, Pſal.</hi> 12.1. Many a man <hi>hath a name, that he is alive, and yet is dead, Rev.</hi> 3.1. Many have a fancie of faith, yet upon the tryall we ſhall find that there are but few, even of thoſe that are intereſted in the title of Chriſtians, and live in the boſome of the Church, that have any right or title to the Lord Jeſus, and the promiſes of God revealed in the Church. Let us try a few.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, this falleth marvellous heavy upon, and caſteth out all ignorant perſons, that were never inlightned, never quickned, never had their mindes informed, touching Chriſt and the promiſes. Alas, they know not what faith meaneth, and what Chriſt meaneth; and how can theſe walk in the footſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when they never ſaw the way of <hi>Abraham?</hi> But let them goe; my heart pittieth them; I rather chuſe to grapple with thoſe that think themſelves in a better eſtate and condition.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt of this rank are profane perſons, thoſe that live and lie in ſinne, in Sabbath-breaking, ſwearing, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, adultery, and the like. The caſe of ſuch is clear and evident; Theſe are ſo farre from treading in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they hate purity, and holineſſe, and goodneſſe: And as for theſe (if any ſuch be here) let them not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but let me tell them out of Gods Word, that as yet
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114897:95"/>they have not faith, as yet they are not the ſonnes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> What they may be, I know not; I leave them to the Lord, and wiſh them a ſight and apprehenſion of their own condition, and that they may be brought out of that gall of bitterneſſe wherein they are: but as yet, I dare ſay, they are not the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Whoſe ſonnes are they then? My brethren, I am loth to ſpeak it, and I will not; men will not beare theſe words from us, but think that we goe beyond our commiſſion: for my own part, my ſoule trembleth to think of them, their caſe is ſo fearfull: The Lord therefore ſhall ſpeak, and I will ſay nothing. Look into <hi>John</hi> 8. The Scribes and Phariſees came to Chriſt, and began to quarrell with him, and to provoke him to ſay many things, that they might catch him in his ſpeech, oppoſing our Saviour in the courſe of his miniſtry, and labouring to ſuppreſſe his Doctrine: mark how Chriſt reaſoneth there; <hi>I doe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the works of my Father; Yee doe the deeds of your father.</hi> But, ſay they, Abraham <hi>is our father;</hi> and again, <hi>We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God;</hi> but mark our Saviours anſwer, verſe 44. <hi>Yee are of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your father yee will doe.</hi> Thus Chriſt ſpeakes to the Scribes and Phariſees, great men of place, and of great abilities; <hi>You, of your father</hi> Abraham? <hi>No, you are of your father the Devill.</hi> My brethren, I will not ſay it; I beſeech you be not offended; it is the Lord that ſpeaks, and I would fain know that man that date contradict his Word; the caſe is clear, and the Lord will make it good upon his ſoule in another world. <hi>His luſts</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you doe:</hi> What are thoſe? He is an accuſer of the brethren; ſo are theſe: He crieth out againſt, and oppoſeth the purity of Religion; ſo doe theſe men exclaime againſt the niceneſſe and preciſeneſſe of Chriſtians, and blame thoſe that are holy and ſincere: The Devill continued not in the truth; no more doe theſe, they are not governed by the truth, they ſtoop not to it, they yeeld not obedience to it: The Divell is a lyer, and ſpeaketh not the truth; ſo theſe men are contented to lie ſhamefully of their brethren, to broach
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:114897:96"/>ſcandalous things of thoſe that they know to be holy and ſincere: In a word, the Devill is malicious, and envious; ſo are all theſe profane ones, deſperate, unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that caſt off Gods commands, that neglect the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and wallow in the mire of their ſins, that hate the ſinceritie and power of Relgion, that envie and malign the true profeſſors of godlineſs: If the Devill himſelf were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate he could doe no more; and ſurely if there were ever a child like the father, theſe are like him: I will ſay nothing, the Lord himſelf ſpeak to your conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but you will ſay, It is true, Chriſt knew who were the children of the Devill; but can you diſcern them?</p>
                  <p>I ſay nothing, but I can tell you how you may diſcern them: A child of the Devill doth not go inviſible, but may be known, and the Apoſtle tels you, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:</hi> Mark that, <hi>Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſſe is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</hi> I obſerve three things in this Text:
<list>
                        <item>1. That there are children of God, and children of the devill.</item>
                        <item>2. That a man may know them: The Text ſaith ſo plainly, they are not my own words; Conſult I beſeech you with the place, <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devill.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. How a man ſhall know a child of the Devill: <hi>He that worketh not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and he that hateth his brother, is of the devill.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <hi>Hee that worketh not righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is, he that is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and contented, conſtantly to take up a Chriſtian courſe, to walk according to the rule of Gods word, to abſtain from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, to live in all holineſs of life and converſation, to ſtudie and indeavour to keep a good conſcience in all things both towards God, and towards men: <hi>and he that loveth not his brother:</hi> That is, he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth holineſs where he ſees it, that hates a good man, and one that is ſincere, whoſe colour riſeth at ſuch a one, where ever he meets him; who can brook a drunkard, or a ſwearer, or an adulterer; but cannot endure a righteous man, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, one that makes conſcience of his waies: If there be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114897:96"/>any ſuch in this Congregation, I deſire to ſpeak a word to them in the name of the Lord; Let them conſider that what I ſpeak is not my own, and I profeſle that what I ſay is not out of paſſion, or a deſire to ſlander any; but the deſire of my ſoul is, that they may come to the knowledge of the truth, that they may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>You therefore that are given to theſe ſins, and are walking in this way of death, conſider and bethinke your ſelves, and ſay to your ſelves; Oh Lord, how neerly doth this I have heard this day concern me! Alas, I thought not of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I am one that never was a worker of righteouſneſs in all my life, I am one that have hated the ſervants of God, that have ſcorned and loathed the puritie of Religion, and now the Lord hath ſaid it, Chriſt hath ſpoke it, his word hath ſpoke it, that I am the child of the Devill: Alas, it is too too manifeſt to my ſelf, that ſuch a one I am, and God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it much more: What ſhall I doe? Now I pray thee, go thy waies home, break off thy ſins by repentance, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make thy peace with God forthwith, and of the ſon of the Devill to be the Son of God; be mightie with God in prayer to make you his child. And this is all I have to ſpeak to theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me go further, and you ſhall ſee more then theſe cut off from being the ſons of <hi>Abraham;</hi> And ſurely if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſhould come down from heaven, he might complain that there were very few of his ſons to be found upon the earth. In the next place therefore take a taſte of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized profeſſors, ſuch as are not as other men; no common ſwearers, no profaners of the Sabbath, no drunkards, and the like: Theſe men thinke that they go neer indeed to the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet give me leave to ſcan theſe a little, I pray, and to try them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> (you know) did not ſtick with God when hee called him, but was content to be under the command of God and to yeeld to him in every thing. Take now one that hath not the power of godlineſs in his heart; he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it may be, his fingers from filching and ſtealing, abſtains
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114897:97"/>from the groſſe acts of ſin, and from open profaneneſſe; but what ſtrength of grace is there in his ſoul? What mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhall you finde of his ſecret luſts? What ſubduing of ſin within? Alas, aske him what ruleth him, at whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he is, at whoſe call he cometh: I appeal to the ſouls and conſciences of all ſuch men; The command of God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and covetouſneſs calleth, which of theſe is followed? The Lord ſaith to the worldling, come out of thy counting-houſe, and goe to prayer, come and hear my word; the Lord calls to the Gentleman, forſake thy pleaſures and thy ſports, and humble thy ſelfe in ſackcloth and aſhes; and the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for theſe things, the times call for them, who is obeyed? Whoſe commands doe you ſtoop unto? Is there any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand diſobeyed but Gods? If a man preſume on any it is on the Lord: Profits, pleaſures, worldly buſineſs muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, whether the Lord be pleaſed or no, or whether the duties he requireth be performed or no. You that are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Tradeſmen, I appeal to your ſouls, whether the Lord and his cauſe is not the loſer this way: Doth not Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pay for it? Doth not the Word pay for it? Are not the Ordinances alwaies loſers, when any thing of your own cometh in competition? Is it not evident then, that you are not under the command of the word? How doe you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the wrath and threatnings of a mortall man? and yet when you hear the Lord thunder judgements out of his Word, who is humbled? When he calls for faſting and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and mourning, who regards it? <hi>Abraham,</hi> my brethren, did not thus, theſe were none of his ſteps; no, no, he went a hundred mile off of this courſe. The Lord no ſooner ſaid to him, <hi>Forſake thy countrie, and thy kindred, and thy fathers houſe,</hi> but he forſook all, neither friend, nor father, prevailed to detain him from obedience, but he ſtooped willingly to Gods command.</p>
                  <p>Look again to the fifth note and ſtep of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and trie your ſelves a little by that. Are you content to run any hazard for the cauſe of God? To ſpare nothing from him? As <hi>Abraham</hi> withheld not <hi>Iſaac</hi> from God when he
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114897:97"/>required him, ſo are you contented likewiſe to with hold, no, not the deareſt thing you have when God calls for it. If the Lord put you to the tryall, to undergoe trouble, loſſe of goods, impriſonment, baniſhment, are you content to ſtoop to theſe things? to give way and to break through all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Judge your ſelves: If it be ſo, it is well. But let your conſciences ſpeak, nay, let your lives and converſations ſpeak; Doe they not ſhew the contrary? Doth not the very name of danger, the ſight of it a afar off, the voice of ſome great man daſh all your forwardneſſe out of countenance? Nay, if an <hi>Iſaac</hi> come and complain, that thoſe and thoſe things muſt be provided for, and cry out, <hi>Alas, if you take this courſe, what will become of wife and children and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all muſt to ruine,</hi> you preſently give over your profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Did <hi>Abraham</hi> doe thus? No, he did not ſo: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, thinke of it; if you were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you would not, you could not, you durſt not doe ſo.</p>
                  <p>There are yet a third ſort that come ſhort of being the ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they are the cloſe-hearted Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. Theſe are a generation that are of a more refined kinde then the laſt, but howſoever they carry the matter very covertly, yea, and are exceeding cunning, yet the truth will make them known. Many an hypocrite may come thus far, to be content to part with any thing, and outwardly to ſuffer for the cauſe of God, to part with divers pleaſures and luſts, and to perform many holy ſervices: But here is the difference between <hi>Abraham</hi> and theſe men: <hi>Abraham</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook his goods and all, but your cloſe-hearted Hypocrites have alwaies ſome God or other that they doe homage to, their eaſe, or their wealth, or ſome ſecret luſt, ſomething or other they have ſet up as an I doll within them, and ſo long as they may have, and injoy that, they will part with any thing elſe. But thou muſt know, that if thou be one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children, thou muſt come away from thy gods, thy god of pride, of ſelf-love, of vain-glory, and leave worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of theſe, and be content to be governed alone by God and his truth. This ſhall ſuffice for the firſt Uſe, I cannot
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114897:98"/>proceed further in the preſſing thereof, becauſe I would ſhut up all with the time.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Uſe is a word of inſtruction, and it ſhall be but a word or two; That it all the Saints of God muſt walk in the ſame way of life and ſalvation that <hi>Abraham</hi> did, then there is no by-way to bring a man to happineſſe. Look what way <hi>Abraham</hi> went, you muſt goe; there is no more wayes: the ſame courſe that he took muſt be a coppy for you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, a rule, as it were, for you to ſquare your whole converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by: There is no way but one to come to life and happineſſe. I ſpeak it the rather, to daſh that idle deviſe of many carnall men, that think the Lord hath a new invention to bring them to life, and that they need not to goe the ordinary way, but God hath made a ſhorter cut for them. Great men, and Gentlemen, think God will ſpare them; what, muſt they be humbled, and faſt, and pray? that is for poor men, and mean men: their places and eſtates will not ſuffer it; therefore ſurely God hath given a diſpenſation to them. And the poor men, they think it is for Gentlemen, that have more leaſure and time: alas, they live by their labour, and they muſt take paines for what they have, and the refore they cannot doe what is required. But be not deceived: if there be any way beſides that which <hi>Abraham</hi> went, then will I deny my ſelfe: but the caſe is clear, the Lord faith it, the Word faith it; the ſame way, the ſame footſteps that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> took, we muſt take, if ever we will come where <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is. You muſt not baulk in this kind, whoever you are; God reſpecteth no mans perſon: if you would arrive at the ſame haven, you muſt ſaile thorough the ſame ſea; you muſt walk the ſame way of grace, if you would come to the ſame kingdome of glory. It is a conceit that harboureth in the hearts of many men, nay, of moſt men in generall, ſpecially your great wiſe men, and your great rich men, that have better places and eſtates in the world then ordinary; What, think they, may not a man be ſaved without all this adoe? what needs all this? is there not another way beſides this? Surely, my brethren, you muſt teach our Saviour Chriſt, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114897:98"/>the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> another way; I am ſure they never knew other: and he that dreameth of another way, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to goe beſide. There is no ſuch matter as the Devill would perſwade you: it is but his deluſion to keep you under infidelity, and to ſhut you up to deſtruction under falſe and vain conceits. The truth is, here is the way, and the onely way, and you muſt walk here if ever you come to life and happineſſe: therefore be not deceived, ſuffer not your eyes to be blinded, but know, what <hi>Abraham</hi> did, you muſt doe the ſame, if not in action, yet in affection: If God ſay, forſake all, thou muſt doe it, at leaſt in affection; thou muſt ſtill wait upon his power and providence, yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him in all things, be content to ſubmit thy ſelfe to his will. This is the way you muſt walk in, if you ever come to heaven.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe ſhall be a Uſe of Comfort to all the Saints and people of God, whoſe conſciences can witneſſe that they have laboured to walk in the uprightneſſe of their heart as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. I have two or three words to ſpeak to theſe.</p>
                  <p>Be perſwaded out of the Word of God, that your courſe is good, and goe on with comfort, and the God of Heaven be with you; and be ſure of it, that you that walk with <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall be at reſt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and it ſhall never repent you of all the paines that you have taken. Happily it may ſeem painfull and tedious to you; yet, what <hi>Abigail,</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> let me ſay to you: <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>let not my Lord doe this: when the Lord ſhall have done to my Lord according to all the good that he hath ſpoken concerning thee, and ſhall have appointed thee Ruler over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>this ſhall be no greife unto thee, nor offence of heart, that thou haſt ſhed blood cauſeleſſe, or that my Lord hath avenged himſelfe,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.30, 31. My brethren, let me ſay ſo to you; You will finde trouble and inconveniencies, and hard meaſure at the hands of the wicked in this world; many <hi>Nabals</hi> and <hi>Chins</hi> will ſet themſelves againſt you; but goe on, and beat it patiently; know it is a troubleſome way, but a true way,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114897:99"/>it is grievous but yet good, and the end will be happy; it will never repent you, when the Lord hath performed all the good that he hath ſpoken concerning you. Oh! to ſee a man draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his breath low and ſhort, after he hath ſpent many houres and dayes in prayer to the Lord, grapling with his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſtriving to pull down his baſe luſts, after he hath waited upon the Lord in a conſtant courſe of obedience; take but ſuch a man, and ask him, now his conſcience is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the wayes of holineſſe and ſincerity be not irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him, whether he be not grieved with himſelfe for undergoing ſo much needleſſe trouble (as the world thinks it) and his ſoul will then clear this matter; it is true, he hath had a tedious courſe of it, but now his death will be bleſſed; he hath ſtriven for a Crown, and now behold a Crown; now he is beyond the waves; all the contempts, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and outrages of wicked men, are now too ſhort to reach him; he is ſo farre from repenting, that he rejoyceth and triumpheth in reflecting back upon all the pains, and care, and labour of love, whereby he hath loved the Lord Jeſus, in ſubmitting his heart unto him. Take me another man, that hath lived here in pompe and jollity, hath had many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, great preferments, much honour, abundance of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet hath been ever careleſſe of God and of his Word, profane in his courſe, looſe in his converſation, and ask him upon his death-bed, how it ſtandeth with him; Oh! woe the time, that ever he ſpent it as he hath done: now the ſoule begins to hate the man, and the very ſight of him, that hath been the inſtrument with it in the committing of ſinne: now nothing but gall and wormwood remaineth; now the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Adulterers luſt is gone, and nothing but the ſting of conſcience remaineth; now the covetous man muſt part with his goods, and the gall of Aſpes muſt ſtick behinde; now the ſoul ſinks within, and the heart is overwhelmed with ſorrow. Take but theſe two men, I ſay, and judge by their ends, whether ever it will repent you that you have done well, that you have walked in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> My brethren, howſoever you have had many miſeries, yet the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:114897:99"/>Lord hath many mercies for you. God dealeth with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as a father doth with his ſon, after he hath ſent him on a great journey to doe ſome buſines, &amp; the weather falleth foul, and the way proveth dangerous, and many a ſtorm, and great difficulties are to be gone through; oh how the heart of that father pittieth his ſon! how doth he reſolve to requite him, if he ever live to come home again; what preparation doth he make to entertain, and welcome him; and how doth he ſtudy to doe good unto him! My brethren, ſo it is here; I beſeech you, think of it, you that are the Saints and people of God: You muſt finde in your way many troubles and greifes, (and we ought to find them) but be not diſcouraged; the more miſery, the greater mercy. God the father ſeeth his ſervants: and if they ſuffer and indure for a good conſcience, as his eye ſeeth them, ſo his ſoul pittieth them, his heart bleeds within him for them, that is, he hath a tender compaſſion of them, and he ſaith within himſelfe, Well, I will requite them if ever they come into my Kingdome; all their patience, and care, and conſcience in walking in my wayes, I will requite, and they ſhall receive a double reward from me, even a Crown of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory. Think of thoſe things that are not ſeen; they are eternall: the things that are ſeen are temporall, and they will deceive us: let our hearts be carried after the other, and reſt in them for ever.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you caſt your eyes, my brethren, upon the beginning of this Chapter, you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when the Prophet had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fierce dealing of God with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his people, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. he doth from the ſecond verſe to the words of the Text, and ſo afterwards make known Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious affection towards his own faithfull ſervants, as alſo his dealing with thoſe curſed Hypocrites, that live in the boſome of the Church. In a word (that I may not be long before I come to that which I deſire to deliver to you) in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Lords dealing, firſt with his own people, and then with others that live in the boſome of the Church, to whom he communicateth his ordinances, there are three things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is Gods ſpeciall care of, and his tender love and fatherly affection to thoſe that love and fear his Name, that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:114897:102"/>labour to approve their hearts and waies to him, that are called to the profeſſion of his truth and walk anſwerably thereunto; and that continueth to the ſeventh verſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>the Lord will keep them, and water them every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that <hi>he will keep them night and day,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Prophet expreſſeth Gods ſpeciall care of his ſervants, ſo withall he manifeſteth a ſecret kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure that was in God, even toward thoſe that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, becauſe of the careleſneſs, and fruitleſneſſe that was among them, therefore he was pleaſed to lay his correcting hand upon them, yet ſtill <hi>in meaſure,</hi> with abundance of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and in much compaſſion towards them; and all for their ſpecial good, not to confound, but to humble and better them. And this we have from the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the end of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, where the Prophet, ſheweth, what is the fruit of affliction to thoſe that belong unto God <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Howſoever the Lord loveth his vineyard, yet he will prune it, not to deſtroy it, but to make it the more fruitfull: He onely will take away the ſuperfluous branches, thoſe inordinate luſts that appear in the lives of his ſervants. This is the main iſſue and ſpeciall benefit of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the godly, to ſubdue their corruptions, to purge them, to make them walk more circumſpectly before God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Prophet having thus declared Gods care of his own people, and his fatherly chaſtiſement of them, in the laſt place, from the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe to the end of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his proceedings alſo againſt the curſed Hypocrites that live in the boſome of the Church, againſt thoſe that <hi>have a form of godlineſſe</hi> onely, but <hi>deny the power thereof,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves before the Lord, and appear in his Sanctuary, as if they would doe great matters for him, yet their hearts are naught, and the Lord ſeeth them, and threatneth to deal with them accordingly, and in concluſion denounceth an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter overthrow, an univerſall ruine, and confuſion unto them, ſo as that their eſtates ſhall be altogether helpleſſe; for <hi>their defenced Cities ſhall be deſolate, and their habitations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114897:102"/>and left like a Wilderneſſe;</hi> Yea, ſo helpleſſe ſhall they be, that if a poor ſilly woman come by, ſhee ſhall ſpoil them; <hi>The women come, and ſet them on fire.</hi> Now if it be asked, Why the Lord doth deal thus fiercely with carnall ſinful men, ſeeing though they have no ſtrength of grace in their hearts, yet they are his creatures; The Reaſon is rendred in the words of the Text, <hi>For it is a people of no underſtanding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that made them will not have mercie on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Doe yee inquire the reaſon why the Lord is ſo deeply diſpleaſed with Hypocrites that live in thee boſome of the Church, and why he threatneth to proceed ſo ſeverely with them? Alas, it is no wonder, <hi>for they are a people of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> what ſhew ſoever they make, though they enjoy the Ordinances, yet they are no way fit for Gods ſpirituall building, they are onely fit for the fire of his wrath, though they are in the Church, yet they are not of the Church; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that made them will ſhew them no mercie, and he that formed them, wil not vouchſafe to beſtow any favour upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words there are two things obſervable: Firſt, the judgement of God denounced againſt this people; Secondly, the cauſe of that judgement: Or thus, Firſt, the ſin of this people; Secondly, The judgement of God becauſe of that ſin. The ſin of the people is, <hi>They have no underſtanding:</hi> The judgement of God becauſe of that ſin, <hi>Therefore he that made them will not have mercie on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> Firſt, you ſee the people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending; they want ſanctifying and ſaving knowledge, <hi>they are a people of no underſtanding.</hi> You ſee again the Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this, and proceeding ſeverely againſt them becauſe of this; <hi>Therefore he that made them, will not have mercie on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt of the former, touching the ſin of the people. I will not ſtand long in the opening of the words: Onely thus much obſerve briefly, <hi>It is a people that have no underſtanding:</hi> What kind of people was it? Even thoſe that lived under the means of grace, that enjoyed all the helps and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114897:103"/>that a people could deſire, that had an outward call, and were counted the people of God, thoſe were <hi>a people of no underſtanding.</hi> Howſoever the Lord was pleaſed to inlarge himſelf toward them to beſtow many outward Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges upon them, to ſuffer them to enjoy many ſingular helps, howſoever they were thoſe to whom were committed the Oracles of God, and means of life and ſalvation, yet they remained unfruitfull and unprofitable, they were <hi>a people of no underſtanding,</hi> they had no depth of reach in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things. The point obſervable from hence is thus much, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>People may enjoy the means of knowledge, of life and ſalvation, and yet not withſtanding in the mean time not profit by them, but remain void of the knowledge of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What this knowledge is, and the nature of it, I will open unto you afterward, onely thus much take along with you for the preſent, That by knowledge here, I mean ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Knowledge, no doubt, this people had, and happily a great meaſure of underſtanding, they might know many things that belonged to grace and ſalvation; yet for the main, for the ſubſtance and truth of it, it was not the knowledge of God, it was not ſaving knowledge. A people may be in the boſome of the Church, live under the means of grace, and partake of the Ordinances of God, and yet notwitſtanding all this, be void of the ſaving knowledge of God. This is a Point that ariſeth clearly and evidently from the Text: Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, were in the Church of God, lived under the Ordinances, and enjoyed all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges of the people of God, yet, he ſaith of them, <hi>they are a people of no underſtanding;</hi> they knew nothing of God and ſalvation in a ſanctifying and ſaving manner. It is eaſie to confirm the truth of this Doctrine, by other places of Scripture. The Scribes and Phariſees <hi>ſate in Moſes chair,</hi> and were the teachers of others, and therefore (one would thinke) ſhould have underſtanding themſelves, yet our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14. <hi>That in them was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114897:103"/>the propheſie of</hi> Iſaiah, which ſaith, <hi>By hearing yee ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand, and ſeeing, yee ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive.</hi> It was not any want of means, they could alledge, or that they lacked the Ordinances; for they were alwaies hearing and hearing, they had all the light that could be afforded them to guide their feet into the way of peace, and no queſtion but they waited upon thoſe means, and yet they were not informed, yet they were not inlightned; to know the things that concerned the glory of God, and their own peace in a ſaving manner; they heard, but underſtood not; they ſaw, but perceived not. In the like manner <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.19. the Lord complaineth of his own ſervants, thoſe that ſhould have been neer to him indeed, <hi>Who is blinde, but my ſervant? or deaf, as my meſſenger that I ſent? Who is blind, as he that is perfect, and blind, as the Lords ſervant: Seeing many things, but thou obſerveſt not; opening the eares, but he heareth not:</hi> It is generally conceived, that this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thoſe that drew neer to God even in the Miniſtery and Prieſthood, and were brought up eſpecially for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; yet notwithſtanding, who ſo blind as they were? and who ſo ignorant as the Meſſengers he ſent? It was alſo the Apoſtles complaint of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>whereas for the time they might have been teachers of others, they had need to be taught again which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> Heb. 5.12. Having ſo long a while injoyed the means of grace and ſalvation, and under the light of the Goſpel, and had ſo many gracious inſtructions and reproofs, ſurely they might have been in the higheſt Form in the School of Chriſt, they might have been guiders and teachers of others: yet notwithſtanding they had need themſelves to be taught the very firſt Rudiments, the very <hi>A, B, C.</hi> of Religion, they remained ignorant of the <hi>firſt principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> and <hi>were fitter to be fed with milk, than with ſtrong meat.</hi> In the prophecie of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> the Lord ſendeth the dull and heavie hearted Jews as it were to ſchool to the creatures; <hi>The Storke in the heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow, obſerve the time
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114897:104"/>of their coming; but my people know not the judgement of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 8.7. So <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his maſters crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not conſider.</hi> The people of the Jews, Gods own people, enjoyed more means then ever any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beſides: <hi>They had line upon line, and precept upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> Iſa. 28 10.13. <hi>From the thirteenth yeer of</hi> Joſiah, (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi>) <hi>even unto this day</hi> (that is, the three and twentieth yeer) <hi>the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have ſpoken unto you, riſing early, and ſpeaking, but ye have not hearkned. And the Lord hath ſent unto you all his ſervants the Prophets, riſing early and ſending them, but yee have not hearkned nor enclined your ear to hear,</hi> Jer. 25.3, 4. They had the means of grace you ſee, yet they were unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable under the means; they had helps for knowledge, yet grew not in knowledge. The point then is clear, That, <hi>The People may enjoy the means, and yet remain void of the knowledge of God.</hi> No more therefore for the proof thereof.</p>
                  <p>For the ground of the point a little. You will ask, Is it it poſſible that there ſhould be ſuch ſenceleſſe ignorance in the hearts of men that live in the boſome of the Church, and that any who partake of the Ordinances, and the means of ſalvation, ſhould yet remain a people of no underſtanding?</p>
                  <p>Alas, my brethren, the truth is, it is too too evident. We can ſpeak of great matters, and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) we <hi>thinke we know ſomething,</hi> but this I am ſure of, that though wee have lived long under the means, and have enjoyed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of light, yet notwithſtanding if a man ſhould go from houſe to houſe, even in this City where the means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are more then ordinary, he ſhould find a marvellous poor deal of ſanctifying and ſaving knowledge, yea, I doe aſſure you, of any reaſonable common knowledge in matters of Religion. If you ask, What is the ground of all this? I will anſwer briefly in two or three words.</p>
                  <p>The firſt cauſe why men get no more knowledge, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have the means of knowledge, I take to be the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114897:104"/>blindneſſe of their mindes, the weakneſſe of their judgements, the ignorance that is in their underſtanding. Though they have all the outward helpes that any people have under heaven, yet having a want in themſelves, and a weakneſſe in their own powers and naturall principles, it is impoſſible that ever they ſhould receive any good by thoſe meanes. This is the very cauſe which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. why the Gentiles were <hi>eſtranged from the life of God,</hi> namely, <hi>becauſe their underſtandings were darkned,</hi> and <hi>becauſe of the ignorance that was in their mindes, and the blindneſſe of their heart.</hi> It skilleth not how bright and clear the Sunne ſhineth, if in the mean time the viſive faculty be wanting; if a man have no eyes to ſee, he is never the better for the greateſt light in the world: So it is here; as long as men are full of blindneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their underſtandings, though the light of the Goſpel ſhine in their very faces, it is no mervail they benefit not thereby, for alas they have no eyes. The fault is not in the Goſpel; for that is light: but the fault is in their own ſouls; their underſtanding is darkned, the ſcales of ignorance are grown over the eyes of their mind, they want an inward principle of ſpirituall ſight, and ſo they are not able to reap any benefit by the moſt excellent meanes in the world as they ſhould doe. That is the firſt Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Adde hereunto in the ſecond place, that as they have blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their mind, and ignorance in their judgement, ſo they are meer naturall men: and no further then God is pleaſed by a ſupernaturall work of the ſpirit to goe along with men in the uſe of the meanes, is it poſſible that they ſhould be effectuall. Naturally men are careleſſe and negligent to attend and wait upon God with faithfull painfulneſſe in the uſe of the meanes, and ſo they will continue, till God put another ſpirit into them, and work that in them which will enable them to doe what nature never can doe: And hence it commeth to paſſe, that ſo long as they continue meet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men, they are not able to receive that ſweetneſſe, nor reap that benefit, that otherwiſe they might from the

                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:114897:106"/>Word of God: they have no mind to it, they hear, it may be, but they are not whether they hear or no. <hi>Job</hi> telleth us, that wicked men <hi>ſay unto God, Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes, Job</hi> 21.14. It is a place worthy ſome obſervation; <hi>They ſay unto God, Depart from us;</hi> How doth a man ſay to the Almighty, <hi>Depart from me?</hi> I doe not conceive, that a company of men will be ſo deſperate, as openly to out-face God in his Ordinances, and bid him depart from them, or openly to profeſſe it to all the world, that they deſire not the knowledge of God, nor of his wayes: But they ſaid it in their hearts, and profeſſed it in their lives, being careleſſe of God, and regardleſſe of the meanes of life and ſalvation. When the Word came with counſell, with reproofe, with admonition, and the like, alas they flighted it, they made no regard of it, they neglected it; and as they behaved themſelves toward the counſels and admonitions of the Word, ſo they are ſaid to have behaved themſelves towards God. And, my brethren, it is all one, if hearing the Miniſter ſpeak unto you the word of God, and bring home to you the reproofes, and admonitions, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels thereof, you kick his Word from you, and happily take up armes againſt him; it is all one (I ſay) as if you take up armes againſt God and deſpiſed him: It is a plain caſe; our Saviour himſelfe hath ſaid it, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me, Luke</hi> 10, 16. And ſo thoſe men <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh of, becauſe they manifeſted a careleſſe eſteem of the ordinances, are ſaid to bid God <hi>depart from them,</hi> and to profeſſe, they <hi>deſired not the knowledge of his wayes:</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, it is a tedious thing to us to be convinced out of the Word; we doe not deſire to be perſwaded to doe this or that; we have no heart to heare ſuch things as theſe. This is a generall fault among moſt that live in the boſome of the Church, to manifeſt a want of deſire of the knowledge of the wayes of God. How many ſeverall paſſages are continually extended to men in the preaching of the Word, both counſels and reproofes? ſome whereof it may be they receive: but ſuch
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114897:106"/>as croſſe their diſpoſitions, and thwart them in any pleaſant or profitable courſe of ſinne, oh how tedious are they to their hearts? how unwilling are they to be informed of them? how willingly doe they reject thoſe bleſſed meanes that God, would put into their hands to helpe them to ſalvation? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous it that place 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. Thoſe <hi>mockers</hi> there ſpoken of, that ſhould <hi>come in the laſt dayes, ſaying, Where is the promiſe of his comming?</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith of them, <hi>This they are willingly ignorant of, that the Heavens were of old by the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They are willingly ignorant;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, they are ignorant becauſe they will be ignorant; they doe nto deſire to know that which might convince and reforme them. Look how it is with a truant Scholler; though the Maſter be never ſo carefull in his teaching, and take never ſo great paines with him, yet it is impoſſible that he ſhould thrive in his learning; for happily he comes one day to Schoole, and withdraweth himſelfe a week after, and loſeth more in two dayes then he can get in four: And you that are Tradeſmen know, that a runnagate Apprentiſe cannot poſſibly be informed in his trade, ſo as to behave himſelfe skilfully for his Maſters profit for the preſent, or his own benefit and comfort afterwards: So the truth is, if you ask me the cauſe, why ſo few men are ſavingly inlightned and informed in the wayes of life and ſalvation, notwithſtanding the abundance of meanes that they injoy; Oh it is becauſe we have ſo many truant Schollers in Gods Schoole, ſo many runnagate Apprentiſes from the meanes of ſalvation; this is the cauſe that howſoever there be meanes and teaching enough, yet men are not gainers by theſe good occaſions and opportunities, which God is pleaſed to put into their hands. This, I ſay, is the very reaſon. Let a Miniſter preſſe a man that is ſomewhat looſe in his life, to the performance of good duties, urge him to prayer with his family, to the ſanctifying of the Lords day, to leave his ſwearing, and his vain company, or the like, he will turn the deafe eare to you, and though happily he will not preſently flie in the face of the Miniſter, yet he will ſlight all that he ſaith; he for his part hath other
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:114897:107"/>buſineſſe in hand: no wonder, my brethren, this man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not by the Word, ſeeing his heart is not ſet thereunto, ſeeing he intendeth it not, hath no mind nor deſire of the knowledge of the wayes of God.</p>
                  <p>The laſt and indeed the main reaſon why in this laſt age of the world, wherein the light of the Goſpel ſhineth ſo bright, yet men ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and remain ſtark blind in heavenly things, and though wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are hard by us, yet we continue like a dry and thirſtie wilderneſſe, is, The corruption of mens hearts, in which they are ſetled, and in which they are reſolved to continue, come what will to the contrary. A ſetled and ſecret reſolution that harboureth in the ſouls of men, to maintain ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate luſt or other, is I ſay, a ſpeciall reaſon why the mindes of men are no more inlightned, nor themſelves informed in the waies of life and happineſs. Mark it, I beſeech you; It is a thing that we may eaſily find to be true in our own experience: The retaining of any private luſt, alwaies hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a man from attaining to ſaving knowledge. Look how it is with the bodie of a man, if one have a foul ſtomack, full of very bad and noiſome humors, commonly it breedeth a rheumatick eie, and a ſleepie and drowſie head; Juſt ſo it is alſo with the ſoul; if a mans heart harbour any noyſome luſts, if any ſinfull corruption lodge there, the truth is, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies breeds a blear-eyed judgement, it ſendeth up ſuch ſtreams and miſts into the underſtanding as quite dazeleth it, ſo that it cannot diſcern the truths of God; and hence it cometh to paſſe, that the ſoul being ſetled on its dregs, ſpeak as long as you will, perſwade as much as you can, yet there is no way to prevail, further then God is pleaſed by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand, to break open the heart of a man, and to enlighten it, whether he will or no, as a man may ſay. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 6, 7. this is obſerved to be the main cauſe why men <hi>are ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> They are very good Churchmen (as they ſay) often in the Church, alwaies hearing, and yet notwithſtanding remain as poor, ignorant, ſilly ſots in the main things of life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:114897:107"/>as if they had lived all their dayes in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> What is the reaſon and ground of this? The Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth there of a certain company of widdows, that were <hi>ever learning,</hi> certainly then you would thinke that they were good Schollars, no, that they were not. What was the cauſe, what? alwaies learning, up early, and down late, and yet never come to the knowledge of the truth? What is the cauſe? The Apoſtle telleth you in the ſixt verſe, <hi>They are laden with ſins, and led about with divers luſts;</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>They are of corrupt mindes, reprobate concerning the faith,</hi> or (as it is in the Margent of your Bibles) <hi>of no judgement concerning the faith:</hi> Mark, like unto theſe carnall hearted widdows, there is a ſort of men in the Church of God, that carry the cloak of profeſſion upon them, and will run to every Lecture, and take hold of every occaſion to hear a Sermon, and yet alas know nothing, but are as ſilly and ignorant in the main grounds of Religion, as blind in the things of God, as any in the world: Will you know the reaſon why they thrive not? Obſerve it; <hi>They are laden with luſts, and led about with divers pleaſures;</hi> their hearts cleave cloſe to ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, they harbour ſome boſome luſt in their ſouls; they have a form of godlineſs, but they take not up the power of Religion, becauſe it would remove and diſ-place thoſe luſts that they love ſo well. I beſeech you obſerve that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. When the Lord had a purpoſe to overthrow the people, and to bring a deſolation upon them for their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, he biddeth the Prophet go and preach to them; but to what purpoſe? Not to doe them any good, for he would not ſave them. Well, what courſe then muſt the Prophet take? <hi>Goe</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not; and ſee yee indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavie, and ſhut their eyes; leaſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their cares, and underſtand with their heart, and convert, and bee healed.</hi> I beſeech you obſerve this Text: If they did ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> God would heal them: But
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:114897:108"/>God in his juſt judgement will not have them ſee, nor hear, nor underſtand, that they might not convert, and be healed, and he will accompliſh this work by the Miniſterie of the Prophet, and therefore he ſendeth him to harden them by his preaching, and how? <hi>Make their hearts fat,</hi> and then (as it followeth) their ears will be <hi>heavie,</hi> and their eies will be <hi>ſhut.</hi> Now (obſerve) what makes an heart fat? Firſt, continuall glutting of ones ſelf with diet, with immoderate eating and drinking; and then ſecondly, continuall ideneſſe; theſe two make men fat: Juſt ſo it is with the ſoul of a ſinner: When as the heart of a man cleaveth to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, when as a mans affections are glued unto it, ſo that he takes delight in it, let it be what luſt ſo ever it will be, you ſhall ever finde him feeding upon it. The proud man continually feeds himſelf upon his pride, his minde is ever taken up with the thoughts of this or that faſhion, with this or that way of attiring, and adorning himſelf; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer is ſtill feeding on the pleaſures of his luſt, alwaies contemplating on thoſe curſed delights. The covetous man, meet him where you will, aſſoon as he is up in a morning, preſently he is talking of buying and ſelling, of bargaining and match-making; So the drunkard and the reſt of ſinners; the meat is never out of their mouthes, their hearts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſet upon thoſe ſinfull corruptions to which they are addicted. And withall (mark) as there muſt bee feeding, ſo there muſt be reſting; for daily exerciſe and labour ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man; and therefore we know thoſe that will feed any creature fat, put it up. So when a man is reſolved to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une in that courſe wherein he is, is ſetled on his lees, hath ſet up his ſtaffe, he will go no further, but there he will ſtay; ſuch a mans heart is fat, and what followeth? his eyes will be blind: Whatſoever ſhall come from the Miniſter to thwart that ſinfull diſpoſition of his, to croſſe that luſt which lieth in his boſome, any way to diſeaſe him, or ſtir him off his dregs, though it be never ſo clear and plain, and delivered with never ſo much evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit of God it ſelf, yet he cares not for it, he is reſolved to do what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114897:108"/>he pleaſeth, and to take his own courſe, let them all ſay what they will. Hence it cometh to paſſe, that in theſe daies of light, wherein the means of knowledge run through the greateſt part of the land, and abound as the rivers from the ſea, and yet men remain ſtark blind in the myſteries of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and altogether unreformed in their lives. Doe but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a little the temper of mens ſpirits, and you ſhall finde it generally to be this: Thoſe truths out of the word of God which they conceive to croſſe their quiet, and diſturbe their peace, they will not indure: Their heart is reſolved to be at peace, and at libertie, come what come will; and therefore whatſoever truth it be that cauſeth any diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſturbance in them, away with it; Oh (ſay they) I will have none of that, I have done with that point. Surely it is no marvell that ſuch men are not informed, ſeeing they have ſhut their eies, and will not ſee: Oh (ſay they) I ſee no reaſon for this, I underſtand not why I may not doc ſuch and ſuch a thing: Yea, you will not underſtand it, you will not be informed, becauſe it will trouble and diſquiet your hearts. There is many a man, my brethren, who if he might have his libertie in ſinfull courſes allowed him, and might injoy his credit, and contentment, and eaſe in the world, together with the Goſpel, would take up many truths that are now deſpiſed by him; but the main ground of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt lies here, he muſt have his ſin, he will take his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he will enjoy himſelf what ever is ſaid to the contrary.

The like I may ſay of many other duties: The Lord calleth for faſting and prayer, and would have his people humble themſelves and ſeek his face: now becauſe the duty is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and happily the world croſſeth it, therefore many will fall out with the Ordinance, reject it, have nothing to doe with it; they will have their eaſe and their quiet; their hearts are grown fat, and if any thing croſſe their corruptions, they will not hear with that eare.

And why? Becauſe you have taken a ſleepy pillow before-hand, you have been reſolved to keep thoſe things that theſe truths croſſe. It is juſt with God, when men doe not love and like to retain the truth he affordeth them, to give them up to a reprobate mind, that is, to a mind void of judgement, not knowing the truth, not approving the Word. And you ſhall ſee theſe men in all their courſes and opinions vaniſhy; Why? Becauſe the Lord hath given them up to a reprobate mind, a mind not able to obſerve what he revealeth, and a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114897:109"/>heart not willing to entertain what he diſcovereth to be good.</p>
                  <p>Gather up theſe things. This is the laſt and moſt ſpeciall argument, why the hearts of moſt men are eſtranged from God and his truth, becauſe they harbour many luſts in their ſoules; and cleave cloſe to ſome or other corruptions. It is a paſſage worthy obſervation, that is recorded <hi>Jer</hi> 43. The people that were left behind in the land, when the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had carried the reſt away captive, were reſolved to goe down into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but they would firſt goe to the Prophet, and take his adviſe, and he muſt goe to the Lord, and whatſoever the Lord ſhould declare to them by the Prophet, that they would doe, be it good, or be it evill: Here was a very fair pretence. But their hearts were fully reſolved betore to goe down into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and therefore when the Prophet brought them the anſwer of God, that they ſhould not goe, but that they ſhould remain in the Land; <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt fatſly,</hi> ſay they unto him, <hi>the Lord our God hath not ſent thee to ſay, Goe not into</hi> Aegypt <hi>to ſojourn there; but</hi> Baruch <hi>the ſonne of</hi> Neriah <hi>ſetteth thee on againſt us. So they obeyed not the voyce of the Lord, to dwell in the ſand of</hi> Judah. As if they ſhould have ſaid, we had thought thou wouldeſt have perſwaded us, that it was lawfull for us to goe down into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and if thou hadſt done ſo, we would have hearkened to thee; but becauſe what thou ſayeſt is not as we would have it, becauſe it doth not fit us, nor ſtand with that courſe we are reſolved to take, we will not yeeld to it, whether it be truth that thou ſpeakeſt or no. I wiſh this were not ſo amongſt many of us, I doe not ſay, carnall and profane ones; the world is full of thoſe, and their ſpirits are too too manifeſt: but I ſay, I wiſh it were not a fault even amongſt many, that in ſome meaſure love and fear the Lord. We are grown ſick of our peace, and we muſt have our quiet, and eaſe, and contentment, therefore though we ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſincere before God in all things, and zealous for the cauſe of the Lord of Hoſts, we will ſhuffle in divers practiſes, rather then be diſturbed and troubled in that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114897:110"/>courſe that we have ſet to our ſelves. Now, I ſay, gather up theſe, and I think the point is clear: If it be ſo that men are blind in their mindes, and cannot know the Word, if ſo be they are careleſſe and doe not attend to the Word, nay, if ſo be they be ſetled in their ſinnes and corruptions from which they will not part, it is no wonder, that though they have means, yet they are not ſavingly informed in the truth of God, anſwerably to thoſe meanes which are beſtowed upon them.</p>
                  <p>Let me adde now but one thing for the full clearing of the Doctrine. You will ſay, we ſee the quite contrary: For it is cleare and evident, that there are many that live in the boſome of the Church, that have a great meaſure of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet are not ſuch as God hath wrought upon effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; yea, the Devill himſelfe hath knowledge enough, and many a man that is nought and carnall, hath an abundant meaſure of underſtanding, happily much more then ſome godly and holy men can attain to.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer this in two or three words. It is true I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, there is many a curſed hypocrite that hath a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge; and yet in very deed hath no true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding at all. For the knowledge whereby ſuch men are inlightned, differs much from that information and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which the Saints of God have. For look as there is wild thime and garden thime, both of the ſame name, and both growing after the ſame manner, yet very different in their nature and qualities: ſo it is with knowledge; there is a gracious and a ſanctifying knowledge, garden knowledge, as I may ſay; and there is a wild and a common knowledge. I will open it a little, in two or three words. If you goe no further, but conſider the underſtanding of both barely, you ſhall cleerly perceive a main difference, between a Saint of God and an Hypocrite.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An Hypocrite, and a carnall man, like <hi>Judas,</hi> may thus farre have his underſtanding inlightned, concerning all the truths of life and ſalvation, that are either diſcovered or made known out of the Book of God, as to perceive the ſenſe of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114897:110"/>the words that are ſet down, and underſtandingly to diſcourſe of the meaning of the Scripture, and reaſon of the points therein contained, and that more freely and abundantly in outward appearance, then many of the deare Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God are able to doe: and yet all this is but that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cals a <hi>form of knowledge, Rom.</hi> 2.20. Such an one hath onely got religion by rote, as we uſe to ſay; like a child, that happily may be taught a ſillogiſme, or ſome forme of an argument, he may ſay it without book, but underſtands it not: ſo hypocrites may have a form, and as it were, an outſide of knowledge, but there is ſomething in the bottome concerning the ſavingneſſe and holineſſe of knowledge, which they can never attain unto. For certain it is, there is never a carnall perſon under heaven, howſoever he can talk of God, and of Chriſt, and of Faith, that either knoweth God in the works of his wayes toward him, or hmſelfe in the works of his duty toward God. That is a ſtrange paſſage concerning <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8, When the Prophet <hi>Eliſha ſetled his countenance upon him, and wept,</hi> Hazael <hi>ſaid, Why weepeth my Lord? And he anſwered, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know the evill that thou wilt doe unto the children of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, and their young men wilt thou ſtay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with childe: And</hi> Hazael <hi>ſaid, But what, is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould doe this great thing?</hi> He thought that there was no ſuch matter in himſelfe, he perceived not the corruption of his nature. And truth it is, that as it was with <hi>Hazael,</hi> ſo it is with every wicked man under heaven, further then God is pleaſed to awaken him, he neither knowes what he is himſelfe, nor what God is; talk of it he may, but cannot apprehend it in truth; in the the generall he may ſpeak of it, but in his own particular he cannot.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the further proof of this point, That there is a main difference between a child of God and an hypocrite, in their very knowledge: though I know it is the judgement of many, and thoſe holy and godly too, that wicked men, in matters of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:114897:111"/>knowledge, may go as far as any Saint under heaven, yet I take it they are deceived: for no ſanctifying work of the holy ſpirit of God is common to thoſe that are wicked and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; but the work of ſaving underſtanding and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is a work of ſanctification: and to prove that, goe no further but to the naked conſideration of a mans bare underſtanding. When the Lord is pleaſed to work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the ſoule, there is a ſanctifying work on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as well as on the will. Now that work which is upon the underſtanding of a ſervant of God, as truly differs from the inlightning of a carnall hypocrite, as the heart of a Saint from the heart of a man not ſanctified: As the Spirit of God, I ſay, hath a proper and peculiar work of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the will of Gods children, ſo alſo hath he upon their mind and underſtanding; therefore of neceſſity, wicked men having no work of ſanctification, the children of God muſt needs differ from them in this particular of knowledge. Again, the Apoſtle is clear enough, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Before a man can diſcern ſpirituall objects, he muſt have ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall light; therefore wicked men being (as all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are) but bare nature, and wanting ſpirituall light, are not able to perceive and diſcern the things of God. So you ſee there is a plain and broad difference between the Saints of God, and carnall hypocrites in the point of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Now then for the point it ſelfe, That there is ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as is peculiar to the Saints; take it, my brethren, thus: The godly doe not onely apprehend the meaning of the words in the Scripture, and are able to diſcourſe of the reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, but they diſcern alſo the ſpiritualneſſe of the work of grace, that is diſcovered in the ſame. Obſerve it: There being, firſt, the Word of God ſet down in his book, and then reaſons that goe along with it, and laſtly, a ſpirituall work of grace, that God hath made known in thoſe reaſons; the Saints of God alone ſee the ſpiritualneſſe of the work
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114897:111"/>that is manifeſted and communicated in that reaſon there ſet down. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, Pſal.</hi> 25.14. wicked men may know repentance, but there is a ſecret of repentance which the godly onely have: Wicked men may pray, but there is an inward ſpiritualneſſe and cloſing with the Lord, a ſecret humbling of the ſoule before the Lord, which the godly onely have: wicked men, I ſay, can pray, and hear, and diſcourſe of repentance, and of faith, and the like, but there is a ſecret in all theſe, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall work derived into the ſoule, thorough the knowledge of all theſe, which the Saints onely apprehend and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Take but an Apple, there is never a man under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can tell what taſt it is of, whether ſweet or ſoure, untill he have taſted of it; he ſeeth the colour and the quantity of it, but knoweth not the taſt: ſo there is no man under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven diſcerneth more of grace then he findeth in himſelfe. A carnall man may talk of repentance, and faith, and obedience, yet notwithſtanding, there is a ſappineſſe, which I call the ſpiritualneſſe in theſe bleſſed works, that no man can tell and underſtand, but onely thoſe that indeed have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the work in themſelves. We uſe to ſay, and we ſay truly, that no woman knoweth the nature of a mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe hath been a mother: So it is here; firſt, a man muſt have the work of grace in himſelfe, before he can rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of it. No man knoweth what it is to be the child of God, or what it is to have a child-like affection toward God, but ſo farre forth as he findeth and feeleth this in ſome meaſure wrought in himſelfe by the operation of the Spirit. I will not diſpute that text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>I will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it:</hi> but I take this to be the main thing intended there, which makes for my preſent purpoſe: <hi>Name</hi> there ſignifies Adoption; and the <hi>white ſtone,</hi> Abſolution: the Lord will abſolve and acquit him of all thoſe ſinnes that he is guilty of, and withall, he will give him the name of a ſonne. The Lord ſealeth to the ſoule of a Chriſtian man, that he is God reconciled to him:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:114897:112"/>Now when the ſoul findeth this, and the like, and withall hath an inward work, which, though happily he cannot diſcover the manner and order thereof, nor expreſſe it to others, yet he knows more thereof then any man under heaven. Ask a child, How doe you know ſuch a man is your father? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, he cannot tell you, yet he hath a ſtrong affection toward him above all others, and feels in himſelf ſuch a leaning in his affection towards him, as another feels not. So the mother of the child that was brought before <hi>Solomon,</hi> had no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world to prove the child to be hers, but the yerning of her bowels, and relenting of her ſpirit toward the child, proved it ſufficiently. So there is in a Saint of God an inward tenderneſs of affection, a leaning of his ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, which no man knowes but he that hath it.</p>
                  <p>If a curious workman after he hath made a clock or a watch, ſhew the frame thereof to a man ignorant of that Art, and declare to him the manner of making it, happily he will conceive his words, and his reaſons, and perceive that he ſaith truth, but he cannot make ſuch another, becauſe he hath not the Art it ſelf of clock-making: My brethren, ſo it is here, There is a curious frame in the ſoule of a Chriſtian, of grace, of faith, of repentance, of holineſſe, of love, patience, and the like; a bleſſed diſpoſition of heart, whereby the ſoul runneth right toward God and every holy dutie, and ſtrikes right (as I may ſay) in all holy obedience to God; this is a frame reared up by the hand of the Spirit of God alone, in the heart of a Chriſtian. Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who had ſuch a work as this wrought in him, can tell the nature of hope, and of faith, and of repentance; but I that read what he hath written of theſe things, being a naturall man, though happily I underſtand the ſence, and apprehend the meaning of the words, yet the true knowledge of the nature of repentance, or faith, or hope, I cannot poſſibly attain to, ſo long as I remain a meer naturall man: Even as an ignorant man cannot conceive the Art of Watch-making, in that manner as the Artiſt himſelf underſtands it; ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I diſcern the nature of this ſpiritual frame in the heart,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114897:112"/>further then God is pleaſed to teach me this skill by the work of his Spirit within my ſelf. When I finde my own heart wrought upon, then I can beſt diſcover it to another, then doe I know that which before I never underſtood; though happily I could diſcourſe ſomething concerning ſuch things, and underſtand the outſide as it were, yet that was all, I never knew the bottom, as I doe now. You ſee then the difference between the knowledge of Hypocrites that live in the boſome of the Church, and the knowledge of Gods Elect, or ſaving knowledge. Now for the Uſe of all in a word or two.</p>
                  <p>If this be ſo, that men may live in the Church of God, and enjoy the means of grace, and yet be <hi>a people of no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> have no ſaving knowledge, then my brethren, here is a word of reproof to check all thoſe conceits, and pull down all thoſe ſilly imaginations of poor, ignorant, carnall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that live here among us in the boſome of the Church, who becauſe the Lord hath been pleaſed to put them into a place where the truth is plainly taught and preached, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perſwade their own ſouls, that they have wiſe dome and knowledge enough to bring them to life and ſalvation. If happily you come to any of theſe men and tell them, that they ought to be inlarged in thoſe duties God requireth of his children, that they ſhould be able to catechiſe their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to pray with them, to inſtruct them, that they ſhould be skilfull in the art of humbling their ſouls before God, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate converſing, and ſpirituall communion with him; Alas, they will anſwer you, that for the preſent, they are too weak and unable for ſuch things as theſe: Well, but prove them again afterwards when they have continued a longer time under the means, and demand of them how they have bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves, what ſtrength of grace they have attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; By no means you muſt meddle with them: What, they have not lived ſo long in a good Pariſh under a panfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and gone ſo often to Church, but ſurely they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring them to heaven; and although they cannot doe ſo, and ſo, though they cannot give you a reaſon of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114897:113"/>hope that is in them, yet they make no queſtion but to ſpeed as well as the beſt. Men think it enough to be good Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to have and injoy the helpes God vouchſafeth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth upon his people, to be often hearers of the Word read and preached; and ſo reſt themſelves contented, and there ſet up their ſtaffe, though in the mean time they remain as blind, and ignorant, and as carnall as ever. My brethren, be not deceived, the Lord will not be mocked. It is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſalvation, for a man to be an often hearer, to have his heart now and then inlarged, to give aſſent to the truths delivered, to conceive the grounds of them, or to be able happily to diſcourſe of ſome points of religion. Oh look further, he that hath ſaving knowledge indeed, goes farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all this. You that are tradeſmen, or you that have children, will any man ſay, my child is a good Schollar, for he hath gone ſo long to ſchoole; or, my Apprentiſe hath good skill in his trade, becauſe he hath ſerved me ſo many yeares? It is true, he ought to be ſo: but it doth not follow, that becauſe he hath had ſuch and ſuch helps, and lived ſo long under them, that therefore he is ſo. So it is here: there is no reaſon for any man to ground his aſſurance of ſalvation on his injoyment of the meanes, or to imagine that God hath wrought mercifully for him in the matter of knowledge, which accompanieth life and happineſs, becauſe of his long living under a good miniſtry: no, it is not enough to have the preaching of the word among us, and to have the meanes and helps of ſaving knowledge; you may have all theſe, and yet remain ignorant and blind, and <hi>be a people of no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is a word of inſtruction to us. We are hence given to underſtand the ſinfulneſſe of our nature, and the blindneſſe of our mindes, ſeeing a man may have all the means under heaven, and yet all prove unprofitable to him; may injoy all the helpes that God hath ſet up in his Church for the good of peoples ſoules, and yet receive no good by them. What a ſtrange heart is ours? Yet ſo it is even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many of us in this place, and I wiſh it were not ſo
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:114897:113"/>with moſt that live in the Church at this day. I fear me, that if a man ſhould goe from heart to heart, and obſerve every ones particular temper, he ſhould find this that I ſay, to bee too too true. What is the reaſon elſe you will not ſuffer a good Miniſter to follow you home, to ſearch your ſoules, but take pet at ſuch a man preſently? what is the cauſe of this? Surely your wayes are naught, your mindes are blinded, your hearts are hardned under the means. Men are loth to let others ſee what they are, becauſe they are not as they ſhould be; they are like dull-headed Schollars, to whom it is death to be poſed. But I ſay, obſerve therefore the mervailous deadneſſe and weakneſſe, the ſtrange beſotted dulneſſe of our natures to good, that when we have all the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and meanes that may be, yet we get no benefit, we reap no profit by them. If a man ſhould have a tree in his garden, that all the dunging, and pruning, and dreſſing that he can uſe, will doe no good of, nor make it bring forth any fruit, certainly he would think that tree to be of a ſtrange temper: ſo here, let us ſee, and wonder when we ſee, that the Lord hath beſtowed ſo much coſt upon us, made his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come home even to our very doores, powred his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on us in abundance, yet we are not provoked, nor quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor inlarged in the wayes of life; that though wind and tide be both with us, yet we make no progreſs in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but he that was ignorant is ignorant ſtill, and he that was filthy is filthy ſtill. That we may therefore ſhame our ſelves, humble our ſoules, and bemoan our eſtates before the Lord, conſider, I pray you, but theſe two things; The variety of helps that God vouchſafeth us, and the ſucceſs thoſe helps find in our hearts. When all the fire in the town cannot warm a man, how cold is he? When all the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions under heaven cannot work upon a man, oh how flinty is he! How graciouſly, my brethren, hath the Lord dealt with you that live in this place? How many helps hath he put into your hands? you have prayers, and ſermons, and exhortations, and inſtructions, and admonitions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114897:114"/>forts, and all things that are available to bring a man to life and happineſs: Now he that groweth not under this means, he that thriveth not with this food, he that is not heated by this fire, he that is not quickned by this dew of heaven, let him take notice of the ſtrange diſtemper of his own heart, and the deadneſſe of his ſpirit. I know not what to ſay to you: Certainly, had the Devill himſelfe but any hope of receiving mercy, the ſermons that are made in this City, were able even to melt his heart, (as it were) and to bring him to conſider, and repent of the ſinnes he hath committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Almighty God: but becauſe he hath no hope of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he remaineth in a forlorne and deſperate condition. Yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The Devils alſo beleeve and tremble;</hi> that is, they know all things contained in Gods Word are true, they beleeve them, and aſſent to them, and are perſwaded, that God will one day make all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings good upon them, and upon the hearts of all the damned for ever, and that they together ſhall be wholly deprived of all thoſe mercies that God hath propounded in his Word, and they tremble at it. Look now into your own hearts, and ſee what kind of temper they are of; when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many judgements that have been threatned, the many woes that have been denounced, yet, moſt either turn their back upon the Church, or turn a deaf eare to what they hear, and caſt the Commandements of God behind them, and rather fleer in the face of the Miniſter, and contemn what he ſaith, then be any wayes humbled for their ſinnes, or tremble at the Word of God, and the threatnings denounced out of it. My brethren, think of it for the Lords ſake, reaſon a little with your ſelves, and conſider, and ſay, Lord, what a wicked heart, and what a wretched diſpoſition have I? the Sea is troubled, the Mountains quake, and the earth ſinketh, when the Lord ſpeaks and uttereth his voice, nay, the Divels beleeve and tremble: but oh! what terrors and woes have I heard out of the Word, againſt my pride, my covetouſneſs, my ſwearing, my drunkenneſs, my profaning of the Sabbath, yet none of them ſtirre me one jot. I have had the fire full
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:114897:114"/>in my face, yet remain as ycie, and cold, and frozen as ever: I have had many a heavenly dew upon me, many a ſilver drop, yet continue a dry and barren Wilderneſs. Oh what a heart have I! Surely, my brethren, ſuch a caſe as this is very deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and deplorable; think of it betime; in vain it will be for you to put it off. You dream, and have conceits of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and imagine that you have faith and repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, alas! you have little or none of theſe graces; I pray there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider it now, and now hear and tremble, leaſt you tremble afterwards, when you are ſunk down in the pit for ever: When you are in hell, you ſhall feel another manner of trembling then now is expected from you; for it ſhall be farre greater, and altogether without hope of remedy. Where now are all thoſe profeſſed enemies and rebels againſt God? where is <hi>Nimrod?</hi> where is <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> where is <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib?</hi> are they not in hell, and there left to periſh for ever? Reaſon the caſe therefore ſeriouſly with your ſelves, to the end that now you may be humbled, and brought to tremble at the Word of God, leaſt hereafter you tremble when all hope is paſt. To move you the more, conſider how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the Lord hath been pleaſed to work upon others: They have heard the Word, and have lived under the light of the Goſpel, and they have received benefit by it, they have attained to good meaſures of ſaving knowledge. Are there not ſome that live neer thee, of whom thou mayeſt ſay, ſuch a man I know, and I thought my ſelfe once to have had as much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in religion as he, I made account I had as much ability to doe God ſervice as ever he had. But now the caſe is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; he is able to diſcourſe ſavourly and feelingly of the things of God, to pray ſenſibly and ſpiritually, to reaſon of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſalvation profitably, farre beyond that which I can doe, and yet I have had as many helpes, I have heard as much, and underſtood as much as he. O Lord, what a caſe is my ſoule in? what a ſinfull creature am I? Here is a drunkard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, there is a profane ſwearer and a Sabbath-breaker wrought upon; my next neighbour, that happily was as bad as I, hath his ſoule humbled; many a gain-ſayer of the Goſpel,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:114897:115"/>the Lord hath made him come crying to him for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſinnes, begging pardon for ſuch and ſuch rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially for his refuſing of the offers of mercy made in Jeſus Chriſt: and all this while I ſtand it out! What a ſtrange heart have I? That drunkard, that profane perſon, that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that covetous wretch is brought home by the Word, and yet my ſoul is not inlightned to know God, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the things of his kingdome! Now the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven open your eyes, and have mercy upon your poor ſoules, and give you the knowledge of his truth, that you may be ſaved.</p>

                  <p>The Firſt is, the Sin that is here committed: <hi>He that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his neck, being often reproved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is, The judgement that is threatned to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:114897:117"/>upon him, agreeable to the nature of the ſin, <hi>He ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> (we ſhall have occaſion to open the words anon) He ſhall be ſhivered all to pieces; God will overthrow him, and all that appertaineth to him. So I take the word is meant.</p>
                  <p>The Sin here is, hardning of the neck, and that is aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the contrary means which God affordeth, and the helps that God putteth into his hands for his good; being often reproved, or as the word carrieth it, being a man of admonitions, one that hath had admonition upon admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Judgement is ſet forth by ſeverall circumſtances, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the qualitie of it. Firſt, <hi>He ſhall be deſtroyed:</hi> And then ſecondly, The manner of it, <hi>Suddenly:</hi> God will not wait long, or vouchſafe ſo much long ſuffering and patience towards him, when once he cometh to that ſin of hardning his neck, under the Means of Grace. And then laſtly, here is the irrecoverableneſſe of him in this his condition, <hi>He ſhall be destroyed without remedie,</hi> there is no hope of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him.</p>
                  <p>For the former, before I come to the Point, you muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me a little to make way for my ſelf, in the opening of two or three paſſages in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Two things there are therefore that we will briefly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What is meant here by hardning the neck?</item>
                     <item>2. What it is to be a man of admonitions. We will not be long in either, onely (as I ſaid) a little to make way for the evident diſcoverie of the point, which we mean to treat of.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>To harden the neck then, it is a ſimilitude taken from Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that are to draw in the yoke, that when they are to come and bow their necks to the yoke, they begin to grow ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and ſtiffe-necked, and refuſe to come under the yoke as the Maſter requireth, and as he expects they ſhould doe, and as thoſe that are taught will doe, whole nature it is to take the yoke willingly and kindly. To harden the neck therefore is, to be ſtubborn and rebellious, not to come
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114897:117"/>under the Commandements of God, which in the Scripture are compared to a yoke, ſo Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Take my yoke upon you;</hi> That is, Submit your ſelves to the Laws of God, to the Statutes and Commandements of God. Now we are ſaid to harden our necks, when as the Heifer in his kind, ſo our ſouls in their kinde, withdraw our ſhoulders (as it were) from the commands of God, that when the will of God is revealed, we will not ſtoop, we will not yeeld and ſubmit to the truths of Chriſt, but take up arms againſt him, and become rebellious to the bleſſed word of God. This is the ſtiffening of the neck; In a word, to be rebellious, to reſiſt, to gainſay the truth of God, the word of God, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is revealed to us, and ought to be done by us.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Phraſe is, <hi>Being often reproved.</hi> The word in the Originall implyeth, (as I ſaid before) a man of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he that hath line upon line, and precept upon precept, admonitions upon admonitions; and therefore our Engliſh rendreth it well, <hi>A man often reproved,</hi> that is, one that hath not onely been once counſelled, and inſtructed, and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but one upon whom the Miniſter is daily calling in the publike Ordinance, one that is from Sabbath to Sabbath, at leaſt, admoniſhed, and perſwaded, and intreated by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, that is, continually, again and again, warned of the wrath to come. If ſuch a man as this gainſay all theſe, and remain ſtubborn and rebellious, after ſo many admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and reproofs, then the judgement of God is ripe for him, and he is ripe for it, <hi>he ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> ſaith the Text, the God of heaven will break him all in peeces (as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaks) and that ſuddenly, without remedie.</p>
                  <p>So then the words being clear, the Point is thus much, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That, <hi>Wicked men grow moſt rebellious under the beſt Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark this I beſeech you, It is not I, but the Text that ſaith as much. <hi>A man that is often reproved, and hardneth his neck.</hi> What is it to harden the neck? I told you, to grow ſtubborn and ſtout-hearted, and to gainſay the truth of God,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114897:118"/>to oppoſe it. And what is it to be often admoniſhed? One Means is here ſpecified, but all are underſtood, he that hath many means, and that hath many helps, and many incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that hath counſell, and advice, and reproof, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, and inſtructions; <hi>If he harden his neck:</hi> So then it is plain, that he may harden his neck, and he doth harden his neck, and grow ſtubborn and rebellious, notwihſtanding all thoſe means, for that is preſumed, and neceſſarily imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Text.</p>
                  <p>The caſe then you ſee is clear, That wicked men that ſhall be deſtroyed, for whom God hath appointed ſudden, and heavie deſolation, and perdition, they grow hard-hearted and rebellious under the beſt means.</p>
                  <p>The point is evident in the Text, we will ſhew you what we have to doe, namely, to make good the thing in hand, which we will eſtabliſh by ſeverall witneſſes, and diſcover the nature of it.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall obſerve this to be a uſuall thing in the courſe of the Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. The Text ſaith there, <hi>That the Lord went and preached, to the ſpirits now in priſon.</hi> What ſpirits were theſe? which once were diſobedient, when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi> Thoſe ſpirits and damned ſouls, thoſe damned Ghoſts now in hell, the ſpirits of wicked men now in hell, what were they? they were thoſe that were diſobedient in the dayes of <hi>Noah: Noah</hi> a preacher of righteouſneſſe, whoſe life was a continuall preaching, who daily called upon them, and was earneſt with them to repent, and there was much long-ſuffering and patience afforded them, God waited long for their amendment, yet thoſe ſouls were then rebellious under ſuch great meanes, and they are now cooped up in Hell.</p>
                  <p>A man would thinke it ſtrange when he ſhall read the ſtorie of <hi>Cain,</hi> that he (notwithſtanding God himſelf came from heaven to teach him) ſhould yet remain obſtinate and ſtout-hearted; and yet (you know the ſtorie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.) you ſee it was ſo. <hi>Cain</hi> began to be diſmaid, and his countenance
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114897:118"/>fell becauſe God regarded not his ſacrifice; Well, God came from heaven, and takes <hi>Cain</hi> to taske; <hi>Cain,</hi> what meaneth all this ſtir? <hi>Why art thou wroth, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doeſt ill, ſin lieth at the door, and unto thee ſhall be his deſire, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi> A man I ſay, would thinke that one ſhould be inſtructed when God himſelf teacheth, yet notwithſtanding after all this Inſtruction of God himſelf (whith in reaſon would be thought as effectuall as could be) <hi>Cain</hi> forſakes God, and flyeth off from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, ſtoopeth not, nor yeeldeth obedience thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This is that which the Prophet <hi>I ſaiah</hi> hath, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 10. <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet he will not learn righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in the land of uprightneſſe will he deal unjuſtly, and will not behold the majeſty of the Lord.</hi> Though there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helps afforded to him, though he be planted in the Church of God, where all things call and cry to him for amendment of life, though the holineſſe, and mercy, and goodneſſe of God compaſſe him about, though he have holy and religious neighbours about him, though he have a good Miniſter in the Pariſh where he is, yet he will not learn righteouſneſſe, but will deal unjuſtly, notwithſtanding all the waſhing, he will remain black ſtill, notwithſtanding all the means that God vouchſafeth for his good, yet he will be naught ſtill.</p>
                  <p>One example you ſhall ſee of this in a paſſage of a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. which makes good the Point in hand. <hi>A certain man,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>planted a vineyard, and ſet a hedge about it, and digged a place for the wine fat, and built a Tower;</hi> (here was much pains, and a great deal of coſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed) Well, he let out this vineyard to husbandmen, and went into a far countrey, and at the ſeaſon he ſent to the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, that he might receive of the fruit of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard: Did he receive any fruit? No, they beat one, and ſtoned another, and killed another, and all the meſſengers they ſent away emptie: At laſt, he ſent his ſon, his welbeloved, but they took him, and killed him, and caſt him out of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114897:119"/>Vineyard. In a word, The Vineyard is the Church of God, and the Husbandmen were the Scribes and Phariſees, they were thoſe to whom God as it were, had let out his Church: He ſendeth his meſſengers, his ſervants the Prophets, riſing early and ſending them, his Apoſtles and Diſciples to call for fruit, for the fruits of holineſs, of faith and obedience, but they abuſed his ſervants, they made him no return of fruit, but when he looked for grapes, behold they brought forth wild grapes: At laſt the Lord ſent his Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he came amongſt them, he that ſpake as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man did ſpeak, ſo that even all the world wondred at the gracious words which did proceed out of his mouth; certainly, ſaith God, <hi>they will reverence my Son,</hi> they will hear him, they will be governed by his directions, they will ſtoop at his command. No, they were then moſt outragious and malicious againſt him, they all banded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, <hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>let us ſlay him,</hi> they joyned heart and hand, and all for his ruine.</p>
                  <p>I will not dwell longer upon the proof of it. See it in nature. The Phyſitian obſerveth it of the ſtomack that is naught, that the beſt meat that a man giveth it, the more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, the better diet, the worſe are the humors that are bred by it. Even ſo it is with a naughtie heart, and it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a moſt wretched diſpoſition, when the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, the beſt Remedies, the beſt diet (as I may ſay) that God can afford a man for his ſpirituall cure, ſhall make the heart the worſe: And truly when the heart is naught, it groweth ſtark naught under the beſt means. No men are ſo bad, as they that live where are the beſt helps for amendment.</p>
                  <p>The thing you ſee is evident in the proof of it, we will a little further diſcover the nature of ſuch men as live under the means, and yet harden their necks, and how that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in the heart, doth diſcover it ſelf moſt, where the beſt means are. And you ſhall ſee it made good in theſe two particulars; That wicked men, corrupt hearts are the worſt under the beſt meanes, though they have admonition after admonition, though they are often reproved.</p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:114897:119"/>
                  <p>Firſt of all, The hearts of thoſe men grow uſually moſt rebellious againſt the Lord, and againſt that truth that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with greateſt power upon them, either diſcoveriing ſin to them, or working effectually upon the ſoul and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The diſpoſition of men uſually that are naught is ſo, that they manifeſt a marvailous fierceneſſe of ſoul, whereby they carry themſelves violently againſt the bleſſed truth and Word of God; and the more, becauſe it is the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull; we have a rule in reaſon, that contraries when they meet, the more violent one is, the more the other will work againſt it, as we may ſee it in fire and water: So it is here, the greater violence, and Spirit, and power, the Word hath in any place, the more violent the heart will ſhew it ſelf in gainſaying the Miniſtry thereof: The more home the Word cometh to the conſcience, and the more powerfully it is applied, either in the convincing of ſin, or perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to holineſs of life, the greater riſings and ſtirrings of heart there is againſt it.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall obſerve this in a paſſage of the ſtory of the men of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19.9. When the curſed <hi>Sodomites</hi> came about the houſe, and would have taken the Angels that came to <hi>Lot, Lot</hi> he came out to them, and ſpake very lovingly to them, but becauſe that which he ſaid, tended to croſſe them in their wicked and unnaturall courſes, mark how they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him: <hi>Stand back,</hi> ſay they, <hi>This one fellow came in to ſojourn, and he will needs be a Judge, now will we deal worſe with thee than with them: and they preſſed ſore upon the man, even</hi> Lot, <hi>and came neer to break the door.</hi> And why was all this? becauſe his arguments were good and ſeaſonable, by which he adviſed them againſt their wicked purpoſe, becauſe he oppoſed them in that wicked courſe of theirs, therefore they could not now hold themſelves, but burſt out into a ſtrange diſtemper of ſpirit, <hi>We will now</hi> (ſay they) <hi>deal worſe with thee, than with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. It is a very obſervable place, <hi>verſ.</hi> 56. When <hi>Stephen</hi> had made a long relation to the Jews of the rebellion and ſtubbornneſs of their Fathers, they heard him
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:114897:120"/>all along without manifeſting any virulencie of ſpirit, but at laſt, when he came out with that, <hi>Yee ſtiffenecked, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart and ears, you doe alwaies reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, as your Fathers did, ſo doe you;</hi> then when they heard theſe things, when <hi>Stephen</hi> made a powerfull applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what he had ſaid to them in particular, and told them, that <hi>they had been the betrayers and murtherers of that juſt One, of whoſe coming the Prophets before had ſhewed, they were cut to the heart, and gnaſhed upon him with their teeth, and they cryed out with a loud voice, and ſtopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord</hi> Theſe were the workings of their corrupt hearts, the more forcible <hi>Stephen</hi> was in the power of the word, the more violent they were in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying that Word.</p>
                  <p>I need ſay no more, onely that is obſervable in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. The Text ſaith there, <hi>That ſin becommeth out of meaſure ſinfull, becauſe of the Commandment.</hi> How is that? It is as if he had ſaid: Sin is the greater, and the more notorious doth it manifeſt it ſelf, by how much the more the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God is the more openly publiſhed, ſin becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of meaſure ſinfull, becauſe that God in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment gainſayeth it, and the more the Commandement is preſſed, the more ſin oppoſeth it, and gainſaies it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the more violent, and ſo grows out of meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, look as it is with a ſtream and current or Rivolet, ſet but a little dam there, and it will run over it eaſily of it ſelfe, but if the dam be ſtrong and high, the River grows deep, and cometh to be great and large: Why ſo? becauſe it is ſtopped. So it is here, the Commandment of God is the dam (as I may ſay) every naturall man hath a ſtream of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is alwaies iſſuing forth in a continued current; if it be ſo now, that the Word of God ſtoppeth him at every turn, in every ungodly practiſe, admitteth of no vent, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no way to any ſinfull courſe, gainſays him in every carnal and ſenſuall delight, barrs him of the ſinfull enjoyment of pleaſures and worldly luſts; then the heart of a ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:114897:120"/>to riſe up againſt God, and againſt his word, and Commandment, and that onely becauſe the Word of God croſſeth him, and gainſayes him. And therefore obſerve it, if there be but a ſleepie-headed Magiſtrate, or a careleſſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in a Congregation, that will lot a great deal of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter go, give leave for the ſtream and current of corruption to paſſe, let men have a vent for their luſts, all will be at great peace, and the ſtream will run as calme as can be; that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhall never have an ill word, that Miniſter that any way permits a vent to corruption, he and his Pariſh ſhall agree as quietly as may be; but if a man be ſtout and couragious, either Magiſtrate or Miniſter, hee ſhall finde violent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and marvailous ſtrivings and workings of heart againſt him, and that word which he delivers, and the means of grace, which God vouchſafeth to a people.</p>
                  <p>Again, as this corruption diſcovers it ſelf, in oppoſing the good word of God, ſo in the ſecond place obſerve another paſſage, wherein the wickedneſſe and rebellion of mens hearts appeareth, notwithſtanding God affordeth them the moſt excellent means of ſalvation. They cleave the cloſer, and cling the more eagerly to their corruptions and ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeem to be croſſed in the eager and violent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of them. As you know it is the nature of ſtubborn ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the more they are forbidden a thing, the more reſolved they are to doe it. I have my ſelf obſerved it in ſome ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born ſervants, that have anſwered their maſters: Why, if you had not ſaid any thing, I would never have done it, but becauſe you keep ſuch adoe, I will doe it the more.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall ſee a proof of it <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. God there had ſent his Prophet early and late, to that people, to ſhew them the good and ancient waies, how they ſhould walk with God, and ſo prevent thoſe Judgements that were threatned and hung over their heads. But mark the Spirit of this people, the more earneſt and violent the Prophet was, out of tender compaſſion to their poor ſouls to win them to God, the more deſperately did they reſolve upon a courſe of ſin, we will walk (ſay they) after our own devices, and we will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:114897:121"/>one doe the imagination of his evill heart. As if they ſhould have ſaid, ſay what you will, we are reſolved what to doe, we will have our ſin, we will not forſake our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; nay, wee will rather cleave the cloſer to them, becauſe you labour to pluck us from them. This is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every man in the world: I appeal to your own conſciences, is it not ſo? Is it not in every ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> more or leſſe, in wicked men wholly, in the Saints partly; obſerve it in your own experience, when that happily the truths of God come and lay ſiege cloſe to your conſciences, that you cannot finde a way and vent for your baſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiſes, but the Word of God croſſeth you; how doe your hearts ſwell, and repine at the Word! How weary are you of your Miniſter! How doe your ſpirits vex at him! And ſo ſometime at the Magiſtrate, if he be more zealous to reform abuſes amongſt men then ordinary. There is, I ſay, a ſecret indignation of ſoul, that every man may finde in himſelf againſt the word of God, and the reproofs thereof.</p>
                  <p>Let us come now to ſee the reaſon why men ſhould be ſo ſenceleſſe and unreaſonable, to grow the worſe becauſe God is the better to them. What ground is there for this? Great ground my brethren, The Reaſons are double, and both moſt evident and plain.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from that inward, and intimate love the ſoul of a wicked man hath to his ſin: This is an everlaſting rule, there is never a naturall man in the world, but he loveth his ſin as he loveth his ſoule; Nay, he makes his ſin his God. And my brethren, the caſe is evident, we need no proof of it, take a tryall of it in your own experience. Let the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God be revealed, let the word of God be never ſo clearly made manifeſt to the hearts of men, let it ſhine never ſo bright even in their very faces; and let there be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved corruption comein the way, and let any one judge, which of theſe is generally more highly prized and eſteemed: you ſhall find a man in ſuch a caſe caſt the Law of God behinde his back, break through all the bars of reſtraint, that the command of God hath laid upon men, and he wil have his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:114897:121"/>he will injoy this luſt, though God and his Word never ſo much oppoſe it. What thinke you doth this man eſteem of moſt, but his own corruption? The Point is evident therefore.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo clear by the example of the young man in the Goſpel. When Chriſt propounded this to him, <hi>That hee muſt ſell all that he had, and give it to the poor, and come and follow him, and expect riches and treaſure in heaven:</hi> The Text ſaith, <hi>He went away ſorrowfull.</hi> The covetous heart of this young man did ſo cling to the world, and to the things thereof, that he made the world his God; and he was contented to part with eternall life, and ſalvation, and Chriſt, and all, rather then with thoſe outward comforts that the world afforded him: The caſe is Evident then: A naturall man makes his ſin his God, and upon that he beſtowes the greateſt of his love and affection, and this appeareth, becauſe he will part with heaven, and happineſs, and all, rather then with it. Mark now what follows: This being a certain rule; then this follows neceſſarily, that which a man loveth moſt, and ſetteth higheſt price upon, when that ſeemeth to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, as it were, to be withdrawn from his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and enjoyment, he is then the moſt eager after it, and labours moſt to detain it, and to keep it ſo much the faſter: What a man loveth moſt, he will have the greateſt care of, eſpecially then, when it ſeemeth to be gone away, or when any other ſhall attempt to deprive him of it. A man hath a care of his money, above all things, at all times, but if he ſee a cheater come to put his hand in his pocket, he will be ſure then to hold it with ſo much the more violence, he will not ſuffer the cheater to take it away, or any thief to deprive him of it. So it is here; the ſoul of a man ſets a high price, and putteth a great eſteem upon every corruption at all times, loves it continually, makes much of it, hides it under his tongue; but when the Miniſter of God cometh to pluck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a mans corruptions, to pluck away the world from the covetous, the ſtrumpet from the adulterer, the cup from the drunkard, ſenſuall delights from the voluptuous; then he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:114897:122"/>holdeth it faſt, then he is carried with ſo much the more violence againſt the Lord, and his truth, and his meſſengers, then he hugs his ſin in both his armes (as it were) becauſe the word would pluck it away from him.</p>
                  <p>It is in this caſe between a naturall man and his ſinne, as it was between <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his goddeſſe <hi>Diana, Acts</hi> 19. you ſhall ſee here, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> began to preach againſt the gods that were made with hands, he ſaid nothing againſt <hi>Diana</hi> in particular, but layes down this for a generall ground and poſition, that they were <hi>no gods that were made with hands, Demetrius</hi> ſoon ſaw the conſequence of this doctrine, that then <hi>Diana</hi> would be no goddeſſe at all; ſee now how <hi>Demetrius</hi> pleadeth the caſe to his fellow crafts-men: <hi>The truth is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we all know, that by this craft we get our livings, and we are all maintained by</hi> Diana, now if ſhe fall to the ground, as one <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth, and laboureth earneſtly to have her down, as being no goddeſſe, if ſhe prove to be no deity, certainly we are all undone, all our trade will come to nothing, therefore let us joyn hands together to defend her honour: <hi>upon this all the City was in an uproar, and there ariſeth a great cry amongſt them, for the ſpace of two houres, Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? <hi>Paul</hi> would pull down <hi>Diana,</hi> therefore it is high time to maintain her honour, <hi>Paul</hi> would throw down the gods made with ſilver and gold, therefore it was high time for him to ſtand for thoſe gods that he might alſo maintain thoſe profits that came to him by them. So it is, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with all the ſinfull courſes of wicked men in the world: All the while the Word of God is ſo taught, that men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no kind of croſsneſſe in it to their own corruptions, men will bear it with much quietneſſe, but if a man have a <hi>Diana</hi> in his heart, a ſinne that he loves, a ſinne that brings him in pleaſure or profit, a ſinne that by no means hee will loſe, as the worldling, he muſt have his gold, and the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer muſt have his queans, and the drunkard his cups, let the Word of God offer but to pluck theſe away, and you ſhall have an uproar preſently, and they will all cry out, our
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114897:122"/>trading will faile, our delights will be gone, and we ſhall never ſee any more good dayes. My brethren, I know not how it is here, but this we find by wofull experience, in the country, too often: Let us but thwrat young men in their ſports, we ſhall ſee them ſo much the more violently bent upon them, even becauſe the will of God is manifeſted to the contrary; And why? The truth is, ſay they, if we give way to the Miniſter, and be ruled by him, and hearken to what he preacheth, then adue to all delights, and comforts, and pleaſures, then adue to all good fellowſhip, and farewell our company, and therefore they are ſo much the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to practiſe thoſe ſinnes that are cryed down in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word, that they may maintain their own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall liberties and ſinfull pleaſures, and they will be ſure when the Miniſter ſpeakes againſt their ſports, and paſtimes, and revellings, to be the more eager in the purſuit of them. And ſo likewiſe the elder ſort, if happily a Miniſter preach, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offereth it ſelfe, againſt ill orders in their families, it may be againſt their tradings, their buyings and ſellings on the Sabbath-day, they will lay all their heads together, how to croſſe the Miniſter, and if it be poſſible, to remove him out of his place, becauſe they love thoſe courſes, and have their gain by them. This is therefore the firſt ground, becauſe they love their corruptions, and what a man loveth, he will be the more eager in the keeping and holding of it.</p>
                  <p>We will now adde the ſecond reaſon: And that is taken from the pride of mens hearts, from the haughtineſſe that harboureth in the heart of wicked men, that they are not able to bear the Commandement of the Lord: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Word of God, in the miniſtry thereof, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any way to over-power them, and to goe beyond them, to maſter their hearts in any way, oh, they think it a matter of diſgrace, and a great diſparagement for them to be ſo baſe, and ſuch ſilly ſimplicians, as to ſtoop to the lure of a poor Miniſter, to be at his beck, and to ſtand at his command. Alas, my brethren, doe you think we preach our ſelves? Indeed in carnall reaſon, if a Miniſter ſhould come in his own
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114897:123"/>name, and lay upon you his own commands, it were fitter for him to ſay nothing then to goe about ſuch a work, in regard of the great diſtance there is between the men of the world, and him, in outward reſpects. But we come in the name of the Lord of heaven, and it is his word that we preach, and the Word of God is powerfull, and will make the ſturdieſt heart to bow or break under it, it is mighty in operation, <hi>like a two-edged ſword, dividing aſunder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the joints and the marrow, ſearching even into the very thoughts of the heart.</hi> Now becauſe the heart of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man is not able, nor indeed willing to ſtoop to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power of the word, loth to be at the beck of Gods command (ſuch naturall pride, and arrogancy of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit there is in carnall men,) that in ſtead of ſubmitting and yeelding thereunto, they take up arms the more againſt it, by how much the more powerfull the word it.</p>
                  <p>It is a pretty paſſage that we read of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> brought the Ark into the field (now the Ark was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt) mark the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when they heard of it: <hi>Woe unto us, for here hath not been ſuch a thing heretofore: Wo unto us, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: us out of the hands of theſe mighty Gods? Be ſtrong therefore, and quit your ſelves like men, O ye Philiſtines, that you be not ſervants unto the Hebrews,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 8, 9. So it is here, when the word of God commeth with a certain kind of commanding power, (as it doth when it is delivered in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit,) if a man indeed preach under the hatches (as I may ſay) as he may eaſily doe, and trouble no man, he ſhall meet with no reſiſtance: but if a man bring the Ark into the field, that is, ſet up the power of Gods Ordinance, labour to advance the Throne and Scepter of the Lord Chriſt in the hearts of men; then mark, to the end that men may not be brought into ſubjection to the Ordinances of God, that they may not ſtoop and be brought under the yoke of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they joyn hand in hand, and ſide one with another, and fight for their liberties, as it were counting it a matter
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:114897:123"/>of baſneſſe, and puſillanimitie to be ſubject to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>You have an example of this ſpirit that is in wicked men in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Wee are lords,</hi> (ſay they there) <hi>wee will ceme no more at thee.</hi> And it is obſervable in that place I named before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.9. <hi>This fellow came to ſojourn with us, and ſhall he be a judge?</hi> there lay the pith of the Argument, and that which moved their wicked ſpirits againſt <hi>Lot,</hi> if <hi>Lot</hi> had ruled them by his counſell, then he ſhould have been maſter over them, therefore ſay they, <hi>Shall he bee a judge?</hi> I could tell you wofull experience that we finde of this: Wicked men, when they are gainſaid, and when the word of God is with that Evidence and power of the Spirit diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, that it will either ſtoop them, or work upon their galled hearts and conſciences, they are not able to bear it, they cannot endure to be under the government of it, therefore they will rebell againſt it, and reſolve, what, ſhall the Miniſter rule us? Doth he thinke to bring us under his girdle, to make us doe what he will, and follow what courſe he will have us take? Shall he be lord over us? It is the ſame alſo with Magiſtrates and with private families: Any means that God uſeth, any admonition whatſoever, findeth ſuch entertainment as this with wicked and carnall hearts.</p>
                  <p>Let this ſuffice for a ſecond Argument and reaſon, why wicked men are ſo marvailous oppoſite againſt the word of God, and the means of grace, even then when it is moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull in gainſaying them and their corruptions, becauſe of the pride of heart that is in all naturall men, whereby they are not able to ſtoop and ſubmit to the yoke and rule thereof, but though they are often admoniſhed, yet they harden their necks.</p>
                  <p>Wee will now come to the Uſe. And to let all other Uſes that might be made of this truth, thus cleared and confirmed alone, I will onely intimate two unto you. What now can we gain from hence thinke you? The caſe you ſee is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and every man muſt ſubſcribe to this as an everlaſting truth, <hi>That wicked men are the worſe, under the beſt means.</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:114897:124"/>You have ſeen the manner of it, and you have ſeen the grounds of it. What gain can we get from this truth?</p>
                  <p>Briefly thus much. Firſt, it is a Uſe of Examination. And next a Uſe of Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>A man may hence clearly ſee his own ſoul as in a glaſſe, and diſcern very plainly what kind of perſon he is, what kinde of courſe he leadeth, in what ſtate and condition he ſtandeth, whether he be a gracious man, or a graceleſſe man; whether a wicked man, or one that God hath a part in yea or no. It concerneth us all, my brethren, very deeply to thinke of it: Conſider well therefore of what hath been ſaid. I would not have you conceive that all this that we have ſpoken is meerly to ſpend out the hour. No, my brethren, you muſt labour to bring your ſouls to be under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the truths delivered: And know this, that whatſoever the Lord ſaith unto you out of his word, he will require it of you, when you come to give up your accounts at that day. Every Sermon a man heareth, he is thereby nearer either to heaven or hell, either he is made better or worſe by it. All mens eſtates in this world are either holy, or unholy; either they are in a ſtate of grace and ſalvation, or in a ſtate of ſin and condemnation. Hence therefore you may take a ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of your conditions, and plainly and clearly ſee how it is with you: Whether you be of the number of thoſe that have infallible Evidences of the work of Gods Spirit in the Miniſterie of the word, tending to holineſs and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or whether you be yet <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquitie.</hi> Whether you be as you came into the world, the children of wrath ſtill, or whether you be begotten again by the immortall ſeed of the Word, <hi>to a lively hope, and to an inheritance with the Saints in light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve what the frame and temper of thy ſoul is, and how it ſtandeth affected to the word of God when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to thy conſcience. If the word prevail not over thee, and over-power thee, if thy heart ſubmit not to the Scepter of the Lord Chriſt, and yeeld to his commands, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thou art not right in the ſight of God. Wee ſay of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:114897:124"/>good ſeed, if it be very good, it proſpereth in all good grounds: if it thrive not in one, the ground, we ſay, is naught. If the phyſick be good, and it work not kindly upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the body, we ſay, is naught, if it work not at all, we reckon that body to be deſperately ill, and in a dangerous eſtate. So it is here, the Word of God is this ſeed, it is this phyſick: if when it is plainly and powerfully diſcovered in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and declaration of the Spirit of God, it work not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to the mortification and purging out of the corruption of nature, if it take not root in the heart, and grow there, and ſpring up to everlaſting life, that heart is naught, and as yet ſuch a one is in a miſerable condition, and never yet had any true experience of the work of grace upon him, never yet found any found and ſaving operation of the ſpirit in him: ſo long as the Word of God, in the miniſtry of it, proves ineffectuall, ſo long doth a man continue under the power of Satan, and a ſlave to divers luſts: If Chriſt in his Word get not the maſtery of the heart, certainly that heart is in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Devill.</p>
                  <p>It is a place of obſervable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The wiſedome of the fleſh</hi> (by fleſh there is meant the corruption of nature) <hi>is enmity againſt God, and</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor indeed can it be.</hi> It is an undoubted argument of a corrupt and unregenerate heart, of an ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and fleſhly heart, that is not, nor cannot be ſubject to the power of the truth of God. I doe not ſay, but the power of the word in judgement, may oftentimes awaken a man, and terrifie the conſcience, and yet the man remain ſtill in the ſtate of nature and unconverted: but I ſay, it is an ill ſigne when the ſoule of a man is not able to ſtoop to that purity, and holineſſe, and goodneſſe, that is revealed in the Word, when a man cannot ſay with the Apoſtle, The Law is holy, and the Commandment holy, and juſt, and good, even then when it gainſayes him in his moſt deareſt ſinne, and directly croſſes him in his wicked courſes. My brethren, God is holy, and his Word is holy, that heart therefore that oppoſeth the Word, and ſtands out againſt it, and refuſeth to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:114897:125"/>give entertainment to it, muſt needs be an unholy heart: where there is a likeneſſe and ſimilitude, there is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is impoſſible for the Word of God, that is pure in it ſelfe, to find any place in an impure heart, he therefore that withſtandeth the Word in the powerfull miniſtry thereof, hath juſt cauſe, not onely to ſuſpect, but to conclude of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he is yet farre from the kingdome of God, and that there is as much difference between God and him, as is between heaven and hell.</p>
                  <p>Mark for this end I beſeech you: a paſſage or two in the Scripture, and ſuffer not your ſelves to be deluded by Satan and your deceitfull hearts. Howſoever a man may make a tuſh of the truth of God now, and think to plead a pretended hope of mercy whatſoever the Miniſter ſaith, yet ſee what the Spirit of God concludeth of ſuch men as withſtand the power of the Word of God in the faithfull miniſtry thereof. Obſerve therefore that place in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 8. It is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a naughty and wicked heart: <hi>As</hi> Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jambres <hi>reſiſted</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſo doe theſe men:</hi> What are theſe men? <hi>Men of corrupt mindes, and reprobate concerning the faith.</hi> If there be a <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> reſiſting <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſtanding out againſt the Word of God, oppoſing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters thereof, who have hearts riſing up againſt the truth of God, when it is evidently and plainly revealed by his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers: What are theſe in the judgement of God? <hi>They are men of corrupt mindes, and reprobate concerning the faith,</hi> That is, they have mindes not knowing, hearts not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the good Word of God, and this is the juſt judgement of God upon them, their mindes are ſo beſotted, and their hearts ſo hardned, that they are fo farre from doing what God requireth, that they deſperately reſiſt it, and take up armes againſt it.</p>
                  <p>You have another paſſage of the Apoſtle to this purpoſe, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt:</hi> but how ſhall we know them? <hi>whoſe god is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame; who mind earthly things:</hi> and what is the end of theſe men? <hi>whoſe end is deſtruction.</hi>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:114897:125"/>It is a clear place; ſuffer not Satan to blind your mindes, my brethren; if this be the truth of God (as it is moſt true that it is ſo) then certainly if any man find his heart guilty of theſe ſinnes, he muſt know himſelfe to be in the ſtate of damnation.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to any mans heart here preſent. Is not the Word of God holy? Is it not a gracious word? Is it not a heavenly truth? doubtleſſe every heart will yeeld to it, that it is a good Word of God. There are none ſo ſenſeleſſe, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that dare openly profeſſe, that they care not for the Word of God, and that there is not ſuch holineſſe, and ſuch goodneſſe in it, as is ſaid to be in it. I dare not think, that there harboureth ſuch a thought ſcarce in the heart of a man that liveth in the boſome of the Church. It is true, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is a holy, and a good, and a heavenly Word. What then ſhall we think of that ſoule, that oppoſeth this holy and gracious Word? muſt we not conclude him to be an unholy and graceleſſe man? muſt not he that oppoſeth this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Word of God, be a helliſh man? Certainly it muſt be a marvailous profane and devilliſh heart, that muſt goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that heavenly truth, whereby the ſoules of the Saints are converted, and brought to heaven, and made capable of the ſight of the face of God, who is holineſſe it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Let men therefore be perſwaded of this truth, and take this Word home with you. I doubt not, but there be ſome in this Congregation, that are yet in their naturall condition, that are not ſubject to the Law of God, that if you purſue them with the power of the Word, they will turn back and reſiſt it, and gainſay it, ſuch ſwine as our Saviour ſpeakes of, that when Pearles are thrown before them, will turn back and flie in the faces of thoſe that diſpence them, and all to rend them. Conſider of it, if thy heart therefore, when the Word of God commeth directly and powerfully home to thee, and laves hold upon thy conſcience, and telleth thee, theſe and theſe ſinnes thou haſt committed, ſuch and ſuch hypocriſies were in thy duties and performances, ſuch wayes of holineſſe and preciſeneſſe thou muſt walk in, and ſuch
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:114897:126"/>courſes of ſinne you muſt forſake, if, I ſay, thy heart gainſay this truth, and thou art carryed violently againſt the Word. Alas poor ſoule! think of it, content not your hearts with your conditions, but confeſſe it, confeſſe thou haſt a graceleſs and naughty heart, this is the next way to be a Chriſtian. It is a ſpeciall ornament of a Chriſtian man, to be contented to be checked by the Word of God, labour therefore to yeeld to the truth when it is revealed. And this is the firſt Uſe, a word of Examination.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is a word of Exhortation, and ſo I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. We are all to be exhorted in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to take notice of this evill that is in our hearts. I ſay, all of us, for howſoever wicked men doe profeſſedly oppoſe the truth of God, and his Word in the faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry thereof, yet the Saints of God themſelves, ſo farre as they are fleſh, have reſiſtances in them; but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, a godly man when he perceiveth his heart ſtubborn and rebellious againſt God in his Word, he yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding joyneth and ſideth with the Word, and laboureth to oppoſe that corruption of the fleſh; ſo it was with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the place before named. A child of God that hath a holy diſpoſition wrought in him by the Spirit of God, when he ſeeth his heart unwilling to yeeld to Chriſt and his Word, he cryeth ſhame upon himſelfe, that after ſo much hearing, ſo many mercies received, ſo many gracious promiſes revealed to him, the good Word of God ſo often laid home to his conſcience, that his heart ſhould yet remain in any meaſure rebellious againſt God; and therefore he reſteth not in this condition, but takes up armes againſt this rebellion of heart, as well as againſt any corruption elſe whatſoever. This, I ſay, is the diſpoſition of a gracious heart. But with a wicked man it is clean contrary.</p>
                  <p>So then I ſay, though it concerneth all naturall men in a ſpeciall manner, to ſuffer this word of exhortation, but ſeeing every man, even the Saints of God themſelves, ſo farre as there is corruption in them, have in them this rebellion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is therefore an exhortation to all to be perſwaded, if we
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:114897:126"/>tender our own good and comforts, not to content our ſelves to be bare hearers, to injoy the means of grace, and to live under the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel, but to labour to bring our hearts to yeeld and ſubmit to the truths revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and to give way to the Word of God, to be contented to be governed by the good Word of God. It is better never to have known the Word of God, then to have it made known, and to gainſay, and ſtand out againſt it. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be carefull to ſubject our ſelves, and to take up the yoke of the Lord, to give way to every truth revealed, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and contented to yeeld to whatſoever the Word of God ſhall make known, whether it declare what is amiſſe, to take that away, or whether it revealeth what is to be done, to practiſe that. This is a bleſſed frame and diſpoſition of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by this we ſhall come to have comfort and benefit by all our hearing; this is the onely way to get that good, that God intendeth in all thoſe helpes and means that he hath appointed in his Church.</p>
                  <p>It is the commendation of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that his heart melted at the hearing of the Law read, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19. And I know not a greater ornament to a Chriſtian, then to have ſuch a heart; that look as it is with ſoft things, they will take any impreſſion that is put upon them, whatſoever the ſtamp or ſeale ſetteth upon them they will take it, print for print, be it of what nature or kind ſoever; ſuch ought to be the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of every ſoule, to have a tender yeelding, melting heart, to be of a pliable, teachable diſpoſition, to give way to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is made known out of the Word.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you therefore take this home to your ſoules, and ſuffer the words of exhortation, let the Word of God take place in your hearts; I would have every Chriſtian ſoule to look up to heaven when he commeth into the Congregation, and to ſay, ſpeak Lord, thy ſervant is deſirous to hear, and contented to hear and obey whatſoever thou ſhalt in this Sermon make known to me. And if the Lord will have any thing, give it him, if he exact any thing from thee, yeeld to him. This is a melting heart.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:114897:127"/>
                  <p>But you will ſay to me (I will conclude in a word or two) How ſhall a man come to bow his neck, and take up the yoke of Chriſt? Here is all the labour, my brethren, and if we could once obtain this, the buſineſſe would be done. God is not leſſe mercifull then he was, the Word is not leſſe powerfull then it was; but theſe hearts of ours are ſtubborn and loth to yeeld to the truth. Labour therefore for this, and have all. But what courſe ſhall we take to compaſſe this?</p>
                  <p>In a word, the means that I would ſuggeſt for the preſent are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, labour to work upon thy own ſoul a kind of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable contentedneſſe, to part with that beloved corruption that lieth in thy boſome. I doe not ſay thou canſt doe it, but I ſay labour to bring thy heart to a reaſonable kind of contentedneſſe this way. For my brethren, here is all the quarrell between you and the Miniſter of God, it all lyeth here, the Lord ſaith, thou muſt forſake thy ſins, or elſe I muſt damn thy ſoul. For we come for ſouls when we come to preach, we doe not come here onely to ſpend an hour, and ſo an end of the matter: No, but we ſee a poor company of creatures in the Congregation, and we know that many among them are yet hardned and blinded, and going head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to perdition, it is now our labour and care to prevent your ruine, and therefore many a prayer we put up, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a tear we ſhed on your behalf. Oh ſuffer your Miniſter therefore, becauſe he deſireth and ſtudieth your good, he ſees you walking in a way in which you muſt needs periſh, and therefore he draweth the ſword of the word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; Oh ſtoop to the word of God revealed. Here now I ſay is all the quarrell, the Miniſter ſaith, you muſt leave your ſins, the ſoul ſaith, I will not, I will have thoſe fins, and I will practiſe thoſe courſes, and therefore thou ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackſt the Miniſter, and thy heart works againſt the Word of God. Alas, Why doe you contend againſt him, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt him, we ſeek not our ſelves but you, nor doe we aim at our own ends, but at the ſalvation of your preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſouls, and notwithſtanding all your oppoſitions, here is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:114897:127"/>the comfort of a Miniſter, that one converted ſoul is better then a whole world, therefore well may he ſweat his heart for it, whatſoever you ſay. But I ſay, if the Miniſter labour thus with God, and with thee for thy ſouls good, why is all this controverſie? Why doſt thou not labour with thy heart to part with thy ſins? It is the deſire of the Miniſter, that it may go well with you, and yours for ever; Is not this reaſonable? Oh, take notice what Traitors there are in your boſomes, that perſwade you to the contrary, begin to think with thy ſelf, of thy own folly, ſay with thy ſelf, Lord, What a beaſt am I: Is not the truth that is revealed to me a plain truth, is it not the truth of God? Is it not for my good to yeeld unto it? Doe not I ſee the heart of the Miniſter earneſt to ſave me? what doth he ſay, but that which is profitable for my ſoul? What is the reaſon that I ſtoop not to this ſo reaſonable a thing, why come not I under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this word, and ſubmit to the government thereof? Oh my corruptions ſay it is unreaſonable, what (doe they ſay) wilt thou ſuffer thy ſin which thou haſt loved, and dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed withall ſo long, thy ſin that hath been of ſuch ancient acquaintance with thee, and yeelded thee ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profit: Wilt thou ſuffer the Word now to pluck it away from thee? My brethren, labour now to lay ſtrong hands upon the Traitor, and to grapple with that boſome-corruption, and work thy ſoul to a contentedneſſe to part with it.</p>
                  <p>And to bring thy heart to this contentedneſs (for all the quarrell is ended if this be done) you muſt profeſſedly come to this Point, whether it be better to loſe an eie, or a tooth, or a limb, and go to heaven lame or blind, or to retain theſe, and go to hell, and loſe your ſoule for ever. Bring I ſay thy ſoul to a ſecrious conſideration of this truth, either I muſt loſe my ſin or my ſoul, there is no third thing to be done, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever carnall reaſon may ſuggeſt other matters, yet it muſt come all to this at laſt: Therefore thinke of it ſeriouſly, and tell your ſouls this in ſecret, if ſin be had, condemnation muſt be entertained by me alſo, chuſe now which you would have. Every man by nature hath this principle in him to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114897:128"/>deſire to ſleep in a whole skin; and therefore we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve men in times of horrour of conſcience, the ſoule is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for its own ſafety, to fling off all for a while. Bring thy heart to it now, and labour to keep it cloſe to this point, either to renounce Chriſt or ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Look as it is with a man that hath a gangrean in his hand or leg, or ſome other venemous diſeaſe: when a man comes to him and he asketh his counſell, and he tels him, that the nature of the diſeaſe is ſuch, that the part muſt be cut off, or elſe all will be infected, this he likes not perhaps, but yet this is not enough to work in him a reſolution of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and therefore he ſendeth for another, and another. But at laſt one commeth and telleth him plainly, either you muſt loſe your hand, or your life, oh then the heart is brought to this, rather take my hand than my life. So it is here, bring thy heart to this therefore, either leave all profaneneſſe, leave all contemning of God, and love of the world, or leave ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, either your life, or your luſt muſt goe, your ſin, or your eternall happineſſe. Work this upon your ſoules every time you come to hear the Word.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing for a man to doe, that he may come to give way to the Word of God, and have a teachable ſoule, is this. Take heed of admitting any carnall reaſonings againſt the truth revealed, and the plain Word of God openly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to you: no carnall ſhifts and evaſions for the ſoul will be thereby cozened. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. you ſhall ſee there, <hi>Moſes</hi> commeth to work upon the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to perſwade him to let <hi>Iſruel</hi> goe, and to work the more effectually upon him, he doth ſome miracles, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw this, he ſent for the Magicians to doe the like, and they did, tis true, <hi>Moſes</hi> Rod eat up their Rods, but in the mean time, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was hardened. The thing is this, my brethren, what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Lord ſaith to every ſoule, let thy ſoule goe that it may ſerve me, let thy heart yeeld obedience to me, that thou mayeſt be bleſſed for ever, there is no remedy, this muſt be done, thou muſt be humbled for thy ſinne and forſake it, or elſe deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:114897:128"/>on followeth. This is the charge which God ſendeth by every faithfull Miniſter: if now a man ſend for ſome carnall reaſon (which is as the Magitians to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) and that ſuggeſts, what needeth all this adoe? what needeth all this niceneſſe and preciſeneſſe, is not God mercifull? and ſhall a man look to be ſaved for his works? why did Chriſt die, if ſalvation were not for ſinners? Oh, my brethren, this will undoe you, theſe are the deluſions of Satan, and meer carnall imaginations, and ſo the ſoule forſakes that repentance that God requireth, and gainſayes that good Word which God hath revealed.</p>
                  <p>Your onely courſe now, my brethren, is to admit of no carnall reaſonings, when the Word of God is plainly and powerfully diſcovered, when you ſee a miraculous hand of God in making known your hidden and ſecret ſinnes, and laying open your eſtates, when God diſcovereth your ſinnes in their own fearfull and ugly ſhape; will you yeeld to fleſhly imaginations, to think, alas, every thing is not Goſpel that the Miniſter ſpeakes, many wiſe men, and great Schollars, and Miniſters too here are, that ſay the quite contrary. This is to hinder the power and efficacy of the Word of God. Admit therefore of no carnall counſell, ſend for no Magitians, when the Lords command is evident and plain, heare nothing againſt the Word of God, but yeeld and captivate your minds to the truths revealed.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument that will bring the heart to ſtoop to the Word of God, it is this, to conſider the excellency and ſoveraign ſuperiority of the Commandment of God.</p>
                  <p>My brethren, it is in vain to dally with the Word of God, you muſt know it is his Word, the Scepter of his Kingdome, that Word by which you muſt be judged, that Word which ſhall ſtand, though heaven and earth change and come to nothing, that which ſhall be made good upon all men, either to their ſalvation or damnation, Therefore be convinced of the majeſty and authority of the Word of God. Doe not think that all the buſineſſe is when you come here, onely to hear a man ſpeak an houre, and ſo have done. No, that which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114897:129"/>you hear is the Word of God, and that Word that is now revealed, it muſt rule you either here, to bring your ſoules to a ſubjection thereunto, or elſe to domineer over you, then when you cannot gainſay it.</p>
                  <p>Many are the ſhiftings and turnings that are in the heart of wicked men, to put off the force and vertue of the Word of God; alas, ſay they, theſe words are but wind, and they break no bones, and ſo men ſcoffe at the threatnings of God. Oh take heed of this, and know (and let your hearts be a wed with it) howſoever it is true, you may gainſay the commands of the Word, yet you ſhall never be able to flie the curſe of the Word. A Miniſter may ſpeak from God to you, and labour with God for you, and all may be caſt aſide, but the Word it ſelf remaineth, and will have its effect one way or other, and that which you now reject, ſhall have dominion over you. Alas, my brethren, the Word we preach it is not our own, it is the Word of God, of the God of Heaven, and know this, that that which will not now be obeyed in the precepts of it, will hereafter be found in the curſe of it.</p>
                  <p>I would fain hear the ſinner that now takes up arms againſt God and his truth, that makes nothing of the Commands he hears, and in effect ſayes, that he will not obey them, I would faine have ſuch a one conſider, what he will ſay at the fearfull day of Judgement. Now God bids thee repent, and beleeve, and obey the Goſpel, and thou wilt not: the Lord then ſhall ſay to thee, <hi>depart from me into everlaſting fire,</hi> I would faine hear a ſinner ſay, Lord, I will not goe down to hell, and be in that pit for ever. My brethren, you are too weak to ſtrive with the Lord, his word may now be gainſaid, but then the Lord ſhall ſay, by this Word that thou haſt diſobeyed thou ſhalt be condemned, and that Word ſhall ſend thee down to the pit, when there will be found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Therefore I beſeech you be perſwaded, rather chuſe the good, that your ſoules may live, and know who you have to deal withall, it is the voyce of God that ſpeakes to you, that voyce that ſhook heaven and earth once, and will doe it again. Therefore let every ſoule be a wed at the mighty
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:114897:129"/>word of God, that being framed according to the rules of it now, you may be bleſſed for ever by it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Work thou when God works, and move thou when God moveth. There is a time when the Spirit of God moves upon the hearts of men in the hearing of the word, when God leaveth ſome impreſſion behind him at a Sermon, that a man may ſay, me thought this day I was almoſt perſwaded, the thought it was reaſon that the Miniſter ſpoke. On work now when God works, take that Word home with thee, and go aſide, and lift up thy hands to heaven, and beſeech the Lord to bleſſe that good word, now that the heart hath been ſtirred, and in ſome meaſure perſwaded, now intreat the Lord buckle and bow they ſoul in perfect obedience to his Majeſtie. Thinke well of this counſell my brethren. There is never a wicked man in the world, that ſlights the power of the word now, but he ſhall be terrified under it, and feel the power of it whether he will or no. If God therefore be pleaſed to ſtir up any thought in thee of this kinde, doe not put it out of thy heart by going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other buſineſſe, or into wicked company, no, take home that ſtroke of God, make it worke more effectually upon thee, converſe with that word every night, and labour to bring thy heart to be affected with it ſtill more and more. This is the next way to be ſure to work when God works. The Devill ſtealeth terror out of the hearts of men, it ſhould be our courſe therefore, that what ever powerfull work God works in any of us in any meaſure, that thou art almoſt a Chriſtian, as <hi>Agrippa,</hi> make one ſtep further, joyn with God, go home and intreat the Lord to ſet it deeper upon thy ſoul, that thou mayeſt not onely be almoſt good, but altogether good, and be ever conſtant in this courſe.</p>
